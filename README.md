| **[Augmenting Smart Contract Decompiler Output through Fine-grained Dependency Analysis and LLM-facilitated Semantic Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08670v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decompiler is a specialized type of reverse engineering tool extensively employed in program analysis tasks, particularly in program comprehension and vulnerability detection. However, current Solidity smart contract decompilers face significant limitations in reconstructing the original source code. In particular, the bottleneck of SOTA decompilers lies in inaccurate method identification, incorrect variable type recovery, and missing contract attributes. These deficiencies hinder downstream tasks and understanding of the program logic. To address these challenges, we propose SmartHalo, a new framework that enhances decompiler output by combining static analysis (SA) and large language models (LLM). SmartHalo leverages the complementary strengths of SA's accuracy in control and data flow analysis and LLM's capability in semantic prediction. More specifically, \system{} constructs a new data structure - Dependency Graph (DG), to extract semantic dependencies via static analysis. Then, it takes DG to create prompts for LLM optimization. Finally, the correctness of LLM outputs is validated through symbolic execution and formal verification. Evaluation on a dataset consisting of 465 randomly selected smart contract methods shows that SmartHalo significantly improves the quality of the decompiled code, compared to SOTA decompilers (e.g., Gigahorse). Notably, integrating GPT-4o with SmartHalo further enhances its performance, achieving precision rates of 87.39% for method boundaries, 90.39% for variable types, and 80.65% for contract attributes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author version of the article accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> |

It is mathematical and highly optimized which makes it prone to subtle bugs not as easily detected by traditional testing.

| **[Divide and Conquer based Symbolic Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13478v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern software development, vulnerability detection is crucial due to the inevitability of bugs and vulnerabilities in complex software systems. Effective detection and elimination of these vulnerabilities during the testing phase are essential. Current methods, such as fuzzing, are widely used for this purpose. While fuzzing is efficient in identifying a broad range of bugs and vulnerabilities by using random mutations or generations, it does not guarantee correctness or absence of vulnerabilities. Therefore, non-random methods are preferable for ensuring the safety and security of critical infrastructure and control systems. This paper presents a vulnerability detection approach based on symbolic execution and control flow graph analysis to identify various types of software weaknesses. Our approach employs a divide-and-conquer algorithm to eliminate irrelevant program information, thus accelerating the process and enabling the analysis of larger programs compared to traditional symbolic execution and model checking methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Divide, Conquer and Verify: Improving Symbolic Execution Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03598v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic Execution is a formal method that can be used to verify the behavior of computer programs and detect software vulnerabilities. Compared to other testing methods such as fuzzing, Symbolic Execution has the advantage of providing formal guarantees about the program. However, despite advances in performance in recent years, Symbolic Execution is too slow to be applied to real-world software. This is primarily caused by the \emph{path explosion problem} as well as by the computational complexity of SMT solving. In this paper, we present a divide-and-conquer approach for symbolic execution by executing individual slices and later combining the side effects. This way, the overall problem size is kept small, reducing the impact of computational complexity on large problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Autoformalize Kinematics?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21840v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous cyber-physical systems like robots and self-driving cars could greatly benefit from using formal methods to reason reliably about their control decisions. However, before a problem can be solved it needs to be stated. This requires writing a formal physics model of the cyber-physical system, which is a complex task that traditionally requires human expertise and becomes a bottleneck. This paper experimentally studies whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate the formalization process. A 20 problem benchmark suite is designed drawing from undergraduate level physics kinematics problems. In each problem, the LLM is provided with a natural language description of the objects' motion and must produce a model in differential game logic (dGL). The model is (1) syntax checked and iteratively refined based on parser feedback, and (2) semantically evaluated by checking whether symbolically executing the dGL formula recovers the solution to the original physics problem. A success rate of 70% (best over 5 samples) is achieved. We analyze failing cases, identifying directions for future improvement. This provides a first quantitative baseline for LLM-based autoformalization from natural language to a hybrid games logic with continuous dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compiling by Proving: Language-Agnostic Automatic Optimization from Formal Semantics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21793v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Verification proofs encode complete program behavior, yet we discard them after checking correctness. We present compiling by proving, a paradigm that transforms these proofs into optimized execution rules. By constructing All-Path Reachability Proofs through symbolic execution and compiling their graph structure, we consolidate many semantic rewrites into single rules while preserving correctness by construction. We implement this as a language-agnostic extension to the K framework. Evaluation demonstrates performance improvements across different compilation scopes: opcode-level optimizations show consistent speedups, while whole-program compilation achieves orders of magnitude greater performance gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Powered Symbolic Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13452v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional static program analysis methods, such as symbolic execution, offering the ability to reason over code directly without relying on theorem provers or SMT solvers. However, LLMs are also inherently approximate by nature, and therefore face significant challenges in relation to the accuracy and scale of analysis in real-world applications. Such issues often necessitate the use of larger LLMs with higher token limits, but this requires enterprise-grade hardware (GPUs) and thus limits accessibility for many users. In this paper, we propose LLM-based symbolic execution -- a novel approach that enhances LLM inference via a path-based decomposition of the program analysis tasks into smaller (more tractable) subtasks. The core idea is to generalize path constraints using a generic code-based representation that the LLM can directly reason over, and without translation into another (less-expressive) formal language. We implement our approach in the form of AutoBug, an LLM-based symbolic execution engine that is lightweight and language-agnostic, making it a practical tool for analyzing code that is challenging for traditional approaches. We show that AutoBug can improve both the accuracy and scale of LLM-based program analysis, especially for smaller LLMs that can run on consumer-grade hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables, published in "Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages & Applications" (OOPSLA), 2025</p></details> |

| **[A unit-based symbolic execution method for detecting memory corruption vulnerabilities in executable codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04258v3)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory corruption is a serious class of software vulnerabilities, which requires careful attention to be detected and removed from applications before getting exploited and harming the system users. Symbolic execution is a well-known method for analyzing programs and detecting various vulnerabilities, e.g., memory corruption. Although this method is sound and complete in theory, it faces some challenges, such as path explosion, when applied to real-world complex programs. In this paper, we present a method for improving the efficiency of symbolic execution and detecting four classes of memory corruption vulnerabilities in executable codes, i.e., heap-based buffer overflow, stack-based buffer overflow, use-after-free, and double-free. We perform symbolic execution only on test units rather than the whole program to lower the chance of path explosion. In our method, test units are considered parts of the program's code, which might contain vulnerable statements and are statically identified based on the specifications of memory corruption vulnerabilities. Then, each test unit is symbolically executed to calculate path and vulnerability constraints of each statement of the unit, which determine the conditions on unit input data for executing that statement or activating vulnerabilities in it, respectively. Solving these constraints gives us input values for the test unit, which execute the desired statements and reveal vulnerabilities in them. Finally, we use machine learning to approximate the correlation between system and unit input data. Thereby, we generate system inputs that enter the program, reach vulnerable instructions in the desired test unit, and reveal vulnerabilities in them. This method is implemented as a plugin for angr framework and evaluated using a group of benchmark programs. The experiments show its superiority over similar tools in accuracy and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoStub: Genetic Programming-Based Stub Creation for Symbolic Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08524v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for software testing, but suffers from limitations when encountering external functions, such as native methods or third-party libraries. Existing solutions often require additional context, expensive SMT solvers, or manual intervention to approximate these functions through symbolic stubs. In this work, we propose a novel approach to automatically generate symbolic stubs for external functions during symbolic execution that leverages Genetic Programming. When the symbolic executor encounters an external function, AutoStub generates training data by executing the function on randomly generated inputs and collecting the outputs. Genetic Programming then derives expressions that approximate the behavior of the function, serving as symbolic stubs. These automatically generated stubs allow the symbolic executor to continue the analysis without manual intervention, enabling the exploration of program paths that were previously intractable. We demonstrate that AutoStub can automatically approximate external functions with over 90% accuracy for 55% of the functions evaluated, and can infer language-specific behaviors that reveal edge cases crucial for software testing.</p></details> | 2025 HUMIES finalist |
| **[Insecurity Through Obscurity: Veiled Vulnerabilities in Closed-Source Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13398v3)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most blockchains cannot hide the binary code of programs (i.e., smart contracts) running on them. To conceal proprietary business logic and to potentially deter attacks, many smart contracts are closed-source and employ layers of obfuscation. However, we demonstrate that such obfuscation can obscure critical vulnerabilities rather than enhance security, a phenomenon we term insecurity through obscurity. To systematically analyze these risks on a large scale, we present SKANF, a novel EVM bytecode analysis tool tailored for closed-source and obfuscated contracts. SKANF combines control-flow deobfuscation, symbolic execution, and concolic execution based on historical transactions to identify and exploit asset management vulnerabilities. Our evaluation on real-world Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bots reveals that SKANF detects vulnerabilities in 1,030 contracts and successfully generates exploits for 394 of them, with potential losses of \$10.6M. Additionally, we uncover 104 real-world MEV bot attacks that collectively resulted in \$2.76M in losses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing Methods for the Cross-Level Verification of SystemC Peripherals with Symbolic Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05504v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual Prototypes (VPs) are important tools in modern hardware development. At high abstractions, they are often implemented in SystemC and offer early analysis of increasingly complex designs. These complex designs often combine one or more processors, interconnects, and peripherals to perform tasks in hardware or interact with the environment. Verifying these subsystems is a well-suited task for VPs, as they allow reasoning across different abstraction levels. While modern verification techniques like symbolic execution can be seamlessly integrated into VP-based workflows, they require modifications in the SystemC kernel. Hence, existing approaches therefore modify and replace the SystemC kernel, or ignore the opportunity of cross-level scenarios completely, and would not allow focusing on special challenges of particular subsystems like peripherals. We propose CrosSym and SEFOS, two opposing approaches for a versatile symbolic execution of peripherals. CrosSym modifies the SystemC kernel, while SEFOS instead modifies a modern symbolic execution engine. Our extensive evaluation applies our tools to various peripherals on different levels of abstractions. Both tools extensive sets of features are demonstrated for (1) different verification scenarios, and (2) identifying 300+ mutants. In comparison with each other, SEFOS convinces with the unmodified SystemC kernel and peripheral, while CrosSym offers slightly better runtime and memory usage. In comparison to the state-of-the-art, that is limited to Transaction Level Modelling (TLM), our tools offered comparable runtime, while enabling cross-level verification with symbolic execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[FuzzRDUCC: Fuzzing with Reconstructed Def-Use Chain Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04967v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary-only fuzzing often struggles with achieving thorough code coverage and uncovering hidden vulnerabilities due to limited insight into a program's internal dataflows. Traditional grey-box fuzzers guide test case generation primarily using control flow edge coverage, which can overlook bugs not easily exposed through control flow analysis alone. We argue that integrating dataflow analysis into the fuzzing process can enhance its effectiveness by revealing how data propagates through the program, thereby enabling the exploration of execution paths that control flow-based methods might miss. In this context, we introduce FuzzRDUCC, a novel fuzzing framework that employs symbolic execution to reconstruct definition-use (def-use) chains directly from binary executables. FuzzRDUCC identifies crucial dataflow paths and exposes security vulnerabilities without incurring excessive computational overhead, due to a novel heuristic algorithm that selects relevant def-use chains without affecting the thoroughness of the fuzzing process. We evaluate FuzzRDUCC using the binutils benchmark and demonstrate that it can identify unique crashes not found by state-of-the-art fuzzers. Hence, establishing FuzzRDUCC as a feasible solution for next generation vulnerability detection and discovery mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reactive Bottom-Up Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03711v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern computing systems remain rife with software vulnerabilities. Engineers apply many means to detect them, of which dynamic testing is one of the most common and effective. However, most dynamic testing techniques follow a top-down paradigm, and struggle to reach and exercise functions deep within the call graph. While recent works have proposed Bottom-Up approaches to address these limitations, they face challenges with false positives and generating valid inputs that adhere to the context of the entire program. In this work, we introduce a new paradigm that we call Reactive Bottom-Up Testing. Our insight is that function-level testing is necessary but not sufficient for the validation of vulnerabilities in functions. What we need is a systematic approach that not only tests functions in isolation but also validates their behavior within the broader program context, ensuring that detected vulnerabilities are both reachable and triggerable. We develop a three-stage bottom-up testing scheme: (1) identify likely-vulnerable functions and generate type- and context-aware harnesses; (2) fuzz to find crashes and extract input constraints via symbolic execution; (3) verify crashes by combining constraints to remove false positives. We implemented an automated prototype, which we call Griller. We evaluated Griller in a controlled setting using a benchmark of 48 known vulnerabilities across 5 open-source projects, where we successfully detected 28 known vulnerabilities. Additionally, we evaluated Griller on several real-world applications such as Pacman, and it discovered 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities. Our findings suggest that Reactive Bottom-Up Testing can significantly enhance the detection of vulnerabilities in complex systems, paving the way for more robust security practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locus: Agentic Predicate Synthesis for Directed Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21302v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes, confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search; however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to generalize to diverse target states and programs. We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x. So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already acknowledged with a draft patch.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Symbolic Execution for Semantic Difference Analysis of Component and Connector Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00749v2)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of model-driven development, ensuring the correctness and consistency of evolving models is paramount. This paper investigates the application of Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) for semantic difference analysis of component-and-connector architectures, specifically utilizing MontiArc models. We have enhanced the existing MontiArc-to-Java generator to gather both symbolic and concrete execution data at runtime, encompassing transition conditions, visited states, and internal variables of automata. This data facilitates the identification of significant execution traces that provide critical insights into system behavior. We evaluate various execution strategies based on the criteria of runtime efficiency, minimality, and completeness, establishing a framework for assessing the applicability of DSE in semantic difference analysis. Our findings indicate that while DSE shows promise for analyzing component and connector architectures, scalability remains a primary limitation, suggesting further research is needed to enhance its practical utility in larger systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Skeleton-Driven SMT Solver Fuzzing by Leveraging LLM to Produce Formula Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20340v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like symbolic execution and automated verification. Because these solvers sit on the critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas are key to uncovering bugs. However, while prior testing techniques performed well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving features. Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain: nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead. In this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. Particularly, Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2) synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars. During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators. This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity. Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment, dramatically reducing runtime cost. We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT solvers: Z3 and cvc5. Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43 confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compositional Symbolic Execution for the Next 700 Memory Models (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15576v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple successful compositional symbolic execution (CSE) tools and platforms exploit separation logic (SL) for compositional verification and/or incorrectness separation logic (ISL) for compositional bug-finding, including VeriFast, Viper, Gillian, CN, and Infer-Pulse. Previous work on the Gillian platform, the only CSE platform that is parametric on the memory model, meaning that it can be instantiated to different memory models, suggests that the ability to use custom memory models allows for more flexibility in supporting analysis of a wide range of programming languages, for implementing custom automation, and for improving performance. However, the literature lacks a satisfactory formal foundation for memory-model-parametric CSE platforms. In this paper, inspired by Gillian, we provide a new formal foundation for memory-model-parametric CSE platforms. Our foundation advances the state of the art in four ways. First, we mechanise our foundation (in the interactive theorem prover Rocq). Second, we validate our foundation by instantiating it to a broad range of memory models, including models for C and CHERI. Third, whereas previous memory-model-parametric work has only covered SL analyses, we cover both SL and ISL analyses. Fourth, our foundation is based on standard definitions of SL and ISL (including definitions of function specification validity, to ensure sound interoperation with other tools and platforms also based on standard definitions).</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic Execution in Practice: A Survey of Applications in Vulnerability, Malware, Firmware, and Protocol Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06643v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic execution is a powerful program analysis technique that allows for the systematic exploration of all program paths. Path explosion, where the number of states to track becomes unwieldy, is one of the biggest challenges hindering symbolic execution's practical application. To combat this, researchers have employed various strategies to enable symbolic execution on complex software systems. This paper introduces a systematic taxonomy of these strategies, categorizing them into two primary approaches: Scope Reduction, which aims to reduce the scope of symbolic execution to manageable portions of code, and Guidance Heuristics, which steer the symbolic execution engine toward promising paths. Using this taxonomy as a lens, we survey applications of symbolic executions in several domains such as vulnerability analysis, malware analysis, firmware re-hosting, and network protocol analysis. Finally, we identify promising directions for future research, including the application of symbolic execution to real-time operating systems and modern, type-safe languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: A...</summary><p>v2: Adds a subsection to Future Directions discussing the role of LLMs in symbolic execution</p></details> |
| **[STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench: Evaluating Complex Multi-Function Comprehension and Fine-Grained Execution Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05193v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code intelligence, yet systematically evaluating their code understanding and reasoning abilities remains challenging. Mainstream benchmarks such as HumanEval and MBPP primarily assess functional correctness, while reasoning benchmarks like CRUXEVAL are limited to single-function, low-complexity scenarios. As a result, advanced models achieve nearly saturated scores, limiting their discriminative power. To address this, we present STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench (SX-Bench), a novel benchmark designed for complex multi-function understanding and fine-grained execution reasoning. SX-Bench features tasks involving collaboration among multiple sub-functions (e.g., chained calls, nested loops), shifting evaluation towards overall control and data flow modeling. It defines "computation steps" as the minimal execution unit and requires models to predict the total number of steps in reasoning tasks, thereby assessing a model's in-depth understanding of dynamic execution beyond simple I/O matching. Evaluation on over 20 mainstream models (including 14 reasoning-enhanced models) demonstrates that SX-Bench is highly discriminative: even the state-of-the-art OpenAI-O3 achieves only 78.37 percent accuracy on Hard-Reasoning tasks, much lower than its saturated scores on previous benchmarks, thereby revealing bottlenecks in complex and fine-grained reasoning. We also release an automated pipeline combining program synthesis, symbolic execution, and LLM-aided validation for efficient benchmark generation and quality assurance. SX-Bench advances code evaluation from "single-function verification" to "multi-function dynamic reasoning," providing a key tool for the in-depth assessment of advanced code intelligence models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Inputs for Grammar Mining using Dynamic Symbolic Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03832v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A vast number of software systems include components that parse and process structured input. In addition to programming languages, which are analyzed by compilers or interpreters, there are numerous components that process standardized or proprietary data formats of varying complexity. Even if such components were initially developed and tested based on a specification, such as a grammar, numerous modifications and adaptations over the course of software evolution can make it impossible to precisely determine which inputs they actually accept. In this situation, grammar mining can be used to reconstruct the specification in the form of a grammar. Established approaches already produce useful results, provided that sufficient input data is available to fully cover the input language. However, achieving this completeness is a major challenge. In practice, only input data recorded during the operation of the software systems is available. If this data is used for grammar mining, the resulting grammar reflects only the actual processed inputs but not the complete grammar of the input language accepted by the software component. As a result, edge cases or previously supported features that no longer appear in the available input data are missing from the generated grammar. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a novel approach for the automatic generation of inputs for grammar mining. Although input generators have already been used for fuzz testing, it remains unclear whether they are also suitable for grammar miners. Building on the grammar miner Mimid, this work presents a fully automated approach to input generation. The approach leverages Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) and extends it with two mechanisms to overcome the limitations of DSE regarding structured input parsers. First, the search for new inputs is guided by an iterative expansion that starts with a single-character input and gradually extends it. Second, input generation is structured into a novel three-phase approach, which separates the generation of inputs for parser functions. The proposed method was evaluated against a diverse set of eleven benchmark applications from the existing literature. Results demonstrate that the approach achieves precision and recall for extracted grammars close to those derived from state-of-the-art grammar miners such as Mimid. Notably, it successfully uncovers subtle features and edge cases in parsers that are typically missed by such grammar miners. The effectiveness of the method is supported by empirical evidence, showing that it can achieve high performance in various domains without requiring prior input samples. This contribution is significant for researchers and practitioners in software engineering, offering an automated, scalable, and precise solution for grammar mining. By eliminating the need for manual input generation, the approach not only reduces workload but also enhances the robustness and comprehensiveness of the extracted grammars. Following this approach, software engineers can reconstruct specification from existing (legacy) parsers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Desyan: A Platform for Seamless Value-Flow and Symbolic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00508v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past two decades, two different types of static analyses have emerged as dominant paradigms both in academia and industry: value-flow analysis (e.g., data-flow analysis or points-to analysis) and symbolic analysis (e.g., symbolic execution). Despite their individual successes in numerous application fields, the two approaches have remained largely separate; an artifact of the simple reality that there is no broadly adopted unifying platform for effortless and efficient integration of symbolic techniques with high-performance data-flow reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce Desyan: a platform for writing program analyses with seamless integration of value-flow and symbolic reasoning. Desyan expands a production-ready Datalog fixpoint engine (Souffl\'e) with full-fledged SMT solving invoking industry-leading SMT engines. Desyan provides constructs for automatically (and efficiently!) handling typical patterns that come up in program analysis. At the same time, the integration is agnostic with respect to the solving technology, and supports Datalog-native symbolic reasoning, via a bottom-up algebraic reasoning module. The result is an engine that allows blending different kinds of reasoning, as needed for the underlying analysis. For value-flow analysis, the engine is the best-in-class Datalog evaluator (often by a factor of over 20x in execution time); for applications that require full SMT (e.g., a concolic execution engine or other symbolic evaluator that needs to solve arbitrarily complex conditions), the engine is leveraging the leading SMT solvers; for lightweight symbolic evaluation (e.g., solving simple conditionals in the context of a path-sensitive analysis), the engine can use Datalog-native symbolic reasoning, achieving large speedups (often of over 2x) compared to eagerly appealing to an SMT solver.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Runtime Verification of Real-Time Systems under Parametric Communication Delays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18282v4)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timed B\"uchi automata provide a very expressive formalism for expressing requirements of real-time systems. Online monitoring and active testing of embedded real-time systems can then be achieved by symbolic execution of such automata on the trace observed from the system. This direct construction however only is faithful if observation of the trace is immediate in the sense that the monitor (or test harness, respectively) can assign exact time stamps to the actions it observes, which is rarely true in practice due to the substantial and fluctuating parametric delays introduced by the circuitry connecting the observed system to its monitoring or testing device. We present purely zone-based online monitoring and testing algorithms, which handle such parametric delays exactly without recurrence to costly verification procedures for parametric timed automata. We have implemented our algorithms on top of the real-time model checking tool UPPAAL, and report on encouraging initial results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Synthesis of Formally Verified Multi-Abstraction Function Summaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09550v3)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function summaries, which characterize the behavior of code segments (typically functions) through preconditions and postconditions, are essential for understanding, reusing, and verifying software, particularly in safety-critical domains like aerospace embedded systems. However, these mission-critical legacy code serving as a valuable reused asset often lacks formal specifications. It is challenging to automatically generate function summaries for C programs, due to the existence of complex features such as loops, nested function calls, pointer aliasing, and so on. Moreover, function summaries should support multiple abstraction levels to meet diverse requirements, e.g. precise summaries capturing full functionality for formal verification and intuitive summaries for human understanding. To address these challenges, we first propose a novel framework that combines symbolic execution, large language models (LLMs), and formal verification to generate Relatively Strongest Postconditions (RSPs) and build function summaries that fully capture program behavior. Our approach leverages VST-A's symbolic execution to precisely track program execution paths and state transitions, employs LLMs to infer loop invariants based on predefined templates, and uses Frama-C to guarantee soundness of generated summaries in an iterative refinement loop. Furthermore, from generated RSPs, we automatically synthesize strongest non-redundant postconditions expressed within given domain specific language. We compare our approach with existing work through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLAMA: Multi-Feedback Smart Contract Fuzzing Framework with LLM-Guided Seed Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12084v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts play a pivotal role in blockchain ecosystems, and fuzzing remains an important approach to securing smart contracts. Even though mutation scheduling is a key factor influencing fuzzing effectiveness, existing fuzzers have primarily explored seed scheduling and generation, while mutation scheduling has been rarely addressed by prior work. In this work, we propose a Large Language Models (LLMs)-based Multi-feedback Smart Contract Fuzzing framework (LLAMA) that integrates LLMs, evolutionary mutation strategies, and hybrid testing techniques. Key components of the proposed LLAMA include: (i) a hierarchical prompting strategy that guides LLMs to generate semantically valid initial seeds, coupled with a lightweight pre-fuzzing phase to select high-potential inputs; (ii) a multi-feedback optimization mechanism that simultaneously improves seed generation, seed selection, and mutation scheduling by leveraging runtime coverage and dependency feedback; and (iii) an evolutionary fuzzing engine that dynamically adjusts mutation operator probabilities based on effectiveness, while incorporating symbolic execution to escape stagnation and uncover deeper vulnerabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that LLAMA outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in both coverage and vulnerability detection. Specifically, it achieves 91% instruction coverage and 90% branch coverage, while detecting 132 out of 148 known vulnerabilities across diverse categories. These results highlight LLAMA's effectiveness, adaptability, and practicality in real-world smart contract security testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[PathFuzzing: Worst Case Analysis by Fuzzing Symbolic-Execution Paths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09892v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating worst-case resource consumption is a critical task in software development. The worst-case analysis (WCA) problem is an optimization-based abstraction of this task. Fuzzing and symbolic execution are widely used techniques for addressing the WCA problem. However, improving code coverage in fuzzing or managing path explosion in symbolic execution within the context of WCA poses significant challenges. In this paper, we propose PathFuzzing, aiming to combine the strengths of both techniques to design a WCA method. The key idea is to transform a program into a symbolic one that takes an execution path (encoded as a binary string) and interprets the bits as branch decisions. PathFuzzing then applies evolutionary fuzzing techniques to the transformed program to search for binary strings that represent satisfiable path conditions and lead to high resource consumption. We evaluate the performance of PathFuzzing experimentally on a benchmark suite that consists of prior work's benchmarks and some added by us. Results show that PathFuzzing generally outperforms a fuzzing and a symbolic-execution baseline.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Bounded Model Checking of RISC-V Machine Code with Context-Free-Language Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09539v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for analyzing the behavior of software yet scalability remains a challenge due to state explosion in control and data flow. Existing tools typically aim at managing control flow internally, often at the expense of completeness, while offloading reasoning over data flow to SMT solvers. Moreover, reasoning typically happens on source code or intermediate representation level to leverage structural information, making machine code generation part of the trust base. We are interested in changing the equation in two non-trivial ways: pushing reasoning down to machine code level, and then offloading reasoning entirely into SMT solvers and other, possibly more efficient solver technology. In more abstract terms, we are asking if bit-precise reasoning technology can be made scalable on software, and not just hardware. For this purpose, we developed two tools called rotor and bitme for model generation and bounded model checking, respectively. We chose RISC-V restricted to integer arithmetic as modeling target for rotor since RISC-V integer semantics is essentially equivalent to established SMT semantics over bitvectors and arrays of bitvectors. While state-of-the-art SMT solvers struggle in our experiments, we have evidence that there is potential for improvement. To show the potential, we have slightly generalized and then implemented in bitme two types of binary decision diagrams (BDDs): algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs) and context-free-language ordered binary decision diagrams (CFLOBDDs). Bitme uses BDDs to propagate program input through models, essentially generalizing constant propagation to domain propagation. SMT solvers only get involved when model input cannot be propagated, significanly speeding up SMT solving. We then study the impact on state explosion of CFLOBDDs, which are potentially more scalable than ADDs.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIFT: Automating Symbolic Execution Optimization with Large Language Models for AI Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04931v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) is a key technique in program analysis, widely used in software testing, vulnerability discovery, and formal verification. In distributed AI systems, DSE plays a crucial role in identifying hard-to-detect bugs, especially those arising from complex network communication patterns. However, traditional approaches to symbolic execution are often hindered by scalability issues and inefficiencies, particularly in large-scale systems. This paper introduces LIFT (Large-language-model Integrated Functional-equivalent-IR Transformation), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the optimization of Intermediate Representations (IRs) in symbolic execution. LIFT addresses the challenges of symbolic execution by providing a scalable, context-sensitive solution for IR transformation. The framework consists of two phases: IR Analysis and Optimization, where LLMs optimize time-intensive IR blocks, and Symbolic Execution and Validation, which includes benchmarking and semantic verification to ensure correctness and generalizability. Experiments on real-world binaries demonstrated significant performance improvements, including a 53.5\% reduction in execution time for bigtest and a 10.24\% reduction for random, along with reductions in IR statements, PUT instructions, and temporary variables. These results demonstrate that LLMs simplify IRs while maintaining functional correctness, enhancing symbolic execution in distributed AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM SIGCOMM 2025 - 2nd Workshop on Networks for AI Computing (NAIC). 7 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Approach to Directed Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04855v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program analysis and automated testing have recently become an essential part of SSDLC. Directed greybox fuzzing is one of the most popular automated testing methods that focuses on error detection in predefined code regions. However, it still lacks ability to overcome difficult program constraints. This problem can be well addressed by symbolic execution, but at the cost of lower performance. Thus, combining directed fuzzing and symbolic execution techniques can lead to more efficient error detection. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach to directed fuzzing with novel seed scheduling algorithm, based on target-related interestingness and coverage. The approach also performs minimization and sorting of objective seeds according to a target-related information. We implement our approach in Sydr-Fuzz tool using LibAFL-DiFuzz as directed fuzzer and Sydr as dynamic symbolic executor. We evaluate our approach with Time to Exposure metric and compare it with pure LibAFL-DiFuzz, AFLGo, BEACON, WAFLGo, WindRanger, FishFuzz, and Prospector. The results show an improvement for 3 out of 7 examples with speedup up to 1.86 times over the second best result, as well as a significant improvement for 3 out of 7 examples over the pure LibAFL-DiFuzz fuzzer. Sydr-Fuzz hybrid approach to directed fuzzing shows high performance and helps to improve directed fuzzing efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fuzzing-based Mutation Testing of C/C++ Software in Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24100v3)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mutation testing can help minimize the delivery of faulty software. Therefore, it is a recommended practice for developing embedded software in safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, state-of-the-art mutation testing techniques for C and C++ software, which are common languages for CPS, depend on symbolic execution. Unfortunately, symbolic execution's limitations hinder its applicability (e.g., systems with black-box components). We propose relying on fuzz testing, which has demonstrated its effectiveness for C and C++ software. Fuzz testing tools automatically create test inputs that explore program branches in various ways, exercising statements in different program states, and thus enabling the detection of mutants, which is our objective. We empirically evaluated our approach using software components from operational satellite systems. Our assessment shows that our approach can detect between 40% and 90% of the mutants not detected by developers' test suites. Further, we empirically determined that the best results are obtained by integrating the Clang compiler, a memory address sanitizer, and relying on laf-intel instrumentation to collect coverage and guide fuzzing. Our approach detects a significantly higher percentage of live mutants compared to symbolic execution, with an increase of up to 50 percentage points; further, we observed that although the combination of fuzzing and symbolic execution leads to additional mutants being killed, the benefits are minimal (a gain of less than one percentage point).</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Correctness in LLM-Based Code Generation via Uncertainty Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11620v3)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we explore uncertainty estimation as a proxy for correctness in LLM-generated code. To this end, we adapt two state-of-the-art techniques from natural language generation -- one based on entropy and another on mutual information -- to the domain of code generation. Given the distinct semantic properties of code, we introduce modifications, including a semantic equivalence check based on symbolic execution. Our findings indicate a strong correlation between the uncertainty computed through these techniques and correctness, highlighting the potential of uncertainty estimation for quality assessment. Additionally, we propose a simplified version of the entropy-based method that assumes a uniform distribution over the LLM's responses, demonstrating comparable effectiveness. Using these techniques, we develop an abstention policy that prevents the model from making predictions when uncertainty is high, reducing incorrect outputs to near zero. Our evaluation on the LiveCodeBench shows that our approach significantly outperforms a baseline relying solely on LLM-reported log-probabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages and 3 References Pages</p></details> |

Not-contains is practically relevant, for instance in symbolic execution of string manipulating programs. Particularly, we show that the predicate $\neg\mathit{Contains}(x_1 \ldots x_n, y_1 \ldots y_m)$, where $x_1 \ldots x_n$ and $y_1 \ldots y_m$ are sequences of string variables constrained by regular languages, is decidable. Decidability of a not-contains predicate combined with chain-free word equations and regular membership constraints follows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating and Understanding Tests via Path-Aware Symbolic Execution with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19287v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic execution is a widely used technique for test generation, offering systematic exploration of program paths through constraint solving. However, it is fundamentally constrained by the capability to model the target code including library functions in terms of symbolic constraint and the capability of underlying constraint solvers. As a result, many paths involving complex features remain unanalyzed or insufficiently modeled. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating diverse and valid test inputs. Yet, LLMs lack mechanisms for systematically enumerating program paths and often fail to cover subtle corner cases. We observe that directly prompting an LLM with the full program leads to missed coverage of interesting paths. In this paper, we present PALM, a test generation system that combines symbolic path enumeration with LLM-assisted test generation. PALM statically enumerates possible paths through AST-level analysis and transforms each into an executable variant with embedded assertions that specify the target path. This avoids the need to translate path constraints into SMT formulae, by instead constructing program variants that LLM can interpret. Importantly, PALM is the first to provide an interactive frontend that visualizes path coverage alongside generated tests, assembling tests based on the specific paths they exercise. A user study with 12 participants demonstrates that PALM's frontend helps users better understand path coverage and identify which paths are actually exercised by PALM-generated tests, through verification and visualization of their path profiles.</p></details> |  |

On the one hand, the analysis needs to be precise enough to draw meaningful conclusions. On the other hand, relevant programs in practice are large and require substantial abstraction. It is this inherent trade-off that is the crux of the problem. In this work, we present AProVE, a tool that uses symbolic execution to analyze termination of memory-manipulating C programs. While traditionally, AProVE's focus was on the preciseness of the analysis, we describe how we adapted our approach towards a modular analysis. Due to this adaption, our approach can now also handle recursive programs. Moreover, we present further performance improvements which we developed to make AProVE scale to large programs.</p></details> |  |

| **[ColorGo: Directed Concolic Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21130v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed fuzzing is a critical technique in cybersecurity, targeting specific sections of a program. This approach is essential in various security-related domains such as crash reproduction, patch testing, and vulnerability detection. Despite its importance, current directed fuzzing methods exhibit a trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, directed grey-box fuzzing, while efficient in generating fuzzing inputs, lacks sufficient precision. The low precision causes time wasted on executing code that cannot help reach the target site. Conversely, interpreter- or observer-based directed symbolic execution can produce high-quality inputs while incurring non-negligible runtime overhead. These limitations undermine the feasibility of directed fuzzers in real-world scenarios. To kill the birds of efficiency and effectiveness with one stone, in this paper, we involve compilation-based concolic execution into directed fuzzing and present ColorGo, achieving high scalability while preserving the high precision from symbolic execution. ColorGo is a new directed whitebox fuzzer that concretely executes the instrumented program with constraint-solving capability on generated input. It guides the exploration by \textit{incremental coloration}, including static reachability analysis and dynamic feasibility analysis. We evaluated ColorGo on diverse real-world programs and demonstrated that ColorGo outperforms AFLGo by up to \textbf{100x} in reaching target sites and reproducing target crashes.</p></details> |  |

Established techniques such as unit testing, static analysis, and program fuzzing provide foundational protection mechanisms. Although symbolic execution tools have made significant contributions, opportunities remain to address the complexities of Go's runtime and concurrency model. In this work, we present Zorya, a novel methodology leveraging concrete and symbolic (concolic) execution to evaluate Go programs comprehensively. By systematically exploring execution paths to uncover vulnerabilities beyond conventional testing, symbolic execution offers distinct advantages, and coupling it with concrete execution mitigates the path explosion problem. Our solution employs Ghidra's P-Code as an intermediate representation (IR). This implementation detects runtime panics in the TinyGo compiler and supports both generic and custom invariants. Furthermore, P-Code's generic IR nature enables analysis of programs written in other languages such as C. Future enhancements may include intelligent classification of concolic execution logs to identify vulnerability patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 23rd IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Management and Applications (SERA 2025)</p></details> |

This practice, however, poses a challenge to traditional verification techniques, which typically assume a single-language environment and, therefore, are insufficient to handle challenges presented by the interplay of different languages. To address this issue, we establish principles for combining multiple programming languages operating on different atomic types using a symbolic execution semantics. This facilitates the (parallel) composition of labeled transition systems, improving the analysis of complex systems by streamlining communication between diverse programming languages. By treating the Dolev-Yao (DY) model as a symbolic abstraction, our approach eliminates the need for translation between different base types, such as bitstrings and DY terms. Our technique provides a foundation for securing interactions in multi-language environments, enhancing program verification and system analysis in complex, interconnected systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors' version; to appear in the 38th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium</p></details> |

Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation across the whole range of LLM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Empc: Effective Path Prioritization for Symbolic Execution with Path Cover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03555v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic execution is a powerful program analysis technique that can formally reason the correctness of program behaviors and detect software bugs. It can systematically explore the execution paths of the tested program. But it suffers from an inherent limitation: path explosion. Path explosion occurs when symbolic execution encounters an overwhelming number (exponential to the program size) of paths that need to be symbolically reasoned. It severely impacts the scalability and performance of symbolic execution. To tackle this problem, previous works leverage various heuristics to prioritize paths for symbolic execution. They rank the exponential number of paths using static rules or heuristics and explore the paths with the highest rank. However, in practice, these works often fail to generalize to diverse programs. In this work, we propose a novel and effective path prioritization technique with path cover, named Empc. Our key insight is that not all paths need to be symbolically reasoned. Unlike traditional path prioritization, our approach leverages a small subset of paths as a minimum path cover (MPC) that can cover all code regions of the tested programs. To encourage diversity in path prioritization, we compute multiple MPCs. We then guide the search for symbolic execution on the small number of paths inside multiple MPCs rather than the exponential number of paths. We implement our technique Empc based on KLEE. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of Empc to investigate its performance in code coverage, bug findings, and runtime overhead. The evaluation shows that Empc can cover 19.6% more basic blocks than KLEE's best search strategy and 24.4% more lines compared to the state-of-the-art work cgs. Empc also finds 24 more security violations than KLEE's best search strategy. Meanwhile, Empc can significantly reduce the memory usage of KLEE by up to 93.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear on 46th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy</p></details> |

This paper aims to investigate the fine-tuning of code-generating LLMs using Reinforcement Learning and Direct Preference Optimization, further improving their performance. To achieve this, we enhance the training data for the reward model with the help of symbolic execution techniques, ensuring more comprehensive and objective data. With symbolic execution, we create a custom dataset that better captures the nuances in code evaluation. Our reward models, fine-tuned on this dataset, demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline, CodeRL, in estimating the quality of generated code. Our code-generating LLMs, trained with the help of reward model feedback, achieve similar results compared to the CodeRL benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Existing kernel extension mechanisms like eBPF rely on in-kernel verifiers to ensure safety of kernel extensions by static verification using symbolic execution. We identify significant usability issues -- safe extensions being rejected by the verifier -- due to the language-verifier gap, a mismatch between developers' expectation of program safety provided by a contract with the programming language, and the verifier's expectation. We present Rex, a new kernel extension framework that closes the language-verifier gap and improves the usability of kernel extensions in terms of programming experience and maintainability. Rex builds upon language-based safety to provide safety properties desired by kernel extensions, along with a lightweight extralingual runtime for properties that are unsuitable for static analysis, including safe exception handling, stack safety, and termination. With Rex, kernel extensions are written in safe Rust and interact with the kernel via a safe interface provided by Rex's kernel crate. No separate static verification is needed. Rex addresses usability issues of eBPF kernel extensions without compromising performance.</p></details> |  |

Vulnerabilities in these embedded RTOSs can lead to compromises of those IoT devices. Despite the significance of security protections, the absence of standardized security guidelines results in various levels of security risk across RTOS implementations. Our initial analysis reveals that popular RTOSs such as FreeRTOS lack essential security protections. While Zephyr OS and ThreadX are designed and implemented with essential security protections, our closer examination uncovers significant differences in their implementations of system call parameter sanitization. We identify a performance optimization practice in ThreadX that introduces security vulnerabilities, allowing for the circumvention of parameter sanitization processes. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a novel attack named the Kernel Object Masquerading (KOM) Attack (as the attacker needs to manipulate one or multiple kernel objects through carefully selected system calls to launch the attack), demonstrating how attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to access sensitive fields within kernel objects, potentially leading to unauthorized data manipulation, privilege escalation, or system compromise. We introduce an automated approach involving under-constrained symbolic execution to identify the KOM attacks and to understand the implications. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of KOM attacks on ThreadX-powered platforms. We reported our findings to the vendors, who recognized the vulnerabilities, with Amazon and Microsoft acknowledging our contribution on their websites.</p></details> |  |

Major new decompilers appear nearly every year and attain popularity, for a multitude of reverse-engineering or tool-building purposes. Technically, the problem is fundamental: it consists of recovering high-level control flow from a highly-optimized continuation-passing-style (CPS) representation. Architecturally, decompilers can be built using either static analysis or symbolic execution techniques. We present Shrknr, a static-analysis-based decompiler succeeding the state-of-the-art Elipmoc decompiler. Shrknr manages to achieve drastic improvements relative to the state of the art, in all significant dimensions: scalability, completeness, precision. Chief among the techniques employed is a new variant of static analysis context: shrinking context sensitivity. Shrinking context sensitivity performs deep cuts in the static analysis context, eagerly "forgetting" control-flow history, in order to leave room for further precise reasoning. We compare Shrnkr to state-of-the-art decompilers, both static-analysis- and symbolic-execution-based. In a standard benchmark set, Shrnkr scales to over 99.5% of contracts (compared to ~95%), covers (i.e., reaches and manages to decompile) 67% more code, and reduces key imprecision metrics by over 65%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of ISSTA 2025 paper</p></details> |

While the results of LLM-based automatic transformation are encouraging, the resulting code cannot be trusted to correctly translate the original code, making manual validation of translated Java code from COBOL a necessary but time-consuming and labor-intensive process. In this paper, we share our experience of developing a testing framework for IBM Watsonx Code Assistant for Z (WCA4Z) [5], an industrial tool designed for COBOL to Java translation. The framework automates the process of testing the functional equivalence of the translated Java code against the original COBOL programs in an industry context. Our framework uses symbolic execution to generate unit tests for COBOL, mocking external calls and transforming them into JUnit tests to validate semantic equivalence with translated Java. The results not only help identify and repair any detected discrepancies but also provide feedback to improve the AI model.</p></details> |  |

Identifying EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells in Multi-chain Reuse Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07589v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the development of Solidity contracts on Ethereum, more developers are reusing them on other compatible blockchains. However, developers may overlook the differences between the designs of the blockchain system, such as the Gas Mechanism and Consensus Protocol, leading to the same contracts on different blockchains not being able to achieve consistent execution as on Ethereum. This inconsistency reveals design flaws in reused contracts, exposing code smells that hinder code reusability, and we define this inconsistency as EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells. In this paper, we conducted the first empirical study to reveal the causes and characteristics of EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells. To ensure the identified smells reflect real developer concerns, we collected and analyzed 1,379 security audit reports and 326 Stack Overflow posts related to reused contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon. Using the open card sorting method, we defined six types of EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells. For automated detection, we developed a tool named EquivGuard. It employs static taint analysis to identify key paths from different patterns and uses symbolic execution to verify path reachability. Our analysis of 905,948 contracts across six major blockchains shows that EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells are widespread, with an average prevalence of 17.70%. While contracts with code smells do not necessarily lead to financial loss and attacks, their high prevalence and significant asset management underscore the potential threats of reusing these smelly Ethereum contracts. Thus, developers are advised to abandon Copy-and-Paste programming practices and detect EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells before reusing Ethereum contracts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISSTA2025</p></details> |
| **[Cache-a-lot: Pushing the Limits of Unsatisfiable Core Reuse in SMT-Based Program Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07642v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers are integral to program analysis techniques like concolic and symbolic execution, where they help assess the satisfiability of logical formulae to explore execution paths of the program under test. However, frequent solver invocations are still the main performance bottleneck of these techniques. One way to mitigate this challenge is through optimizations such as caching and reusing solver results. While current methods typically focus on reusing results from fully equivalent or closely related formulas, they often miss broader opportunities for reuse. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Cache-a-lot, that extends the reuse of unsatisfiable (unsat) results by systematically considering all possible variable substitutions. This enables more extensive reuse of results, thereby reducing the number of SMT solver invocations and improving the overall efficiency of concolic and symbolic execution. Our evaluation, conducted against the state-of-the-art Utopia solution using two benchmark sets, shows significant improvements, particularly with more complex formulas. Our method achieves up to 74% unsat core reuse, compared to Utopia's 41%, and significant increase in the time savings. These results demonstrate that, despite the additional computational complexity, the broader reuse of unsat results significantly enhances performance, offering valuable advancements for formal verification and program analysis.</p></details> |  |

Though prior methods for detecting memory leaks made significant advance, they often suffer from low accuracy and weak scalability for testing large and complex programs. In this paper we present LeakGuard, a memory leak detection tool which provides satisfactory balance of accuracy and scalability. For accuracy, LeakGuard analyzes the behaviors of library and developer-defined memory allocation and deallocation functions in a path-sensitive manner and generates function summaries for them in a bottom-up approach. Additionally, we develop a pointer escape analysis technique to model the transfer of pointer ownership. For scalability, LeakGuard examines each function of interest independently by using its function summary and under-constrained symbolic execution technique, which effectively mitigates path explosion problem. Our extensive evaluation on 18 real-world software projects and standard benchmark datasets demonstrates that LeakGuard achieves significant advancements in multiple aspects: it exhibits superior MAD function identification capability compared to Goshawk, outperforms five state-of-the-art methods in defect detection accuracy, and successfully identifies 129 previously undetected memory leak bugs, all of which have been independently verified and confirmed by the respective development teams.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, conference paper on memory leak detection</p></details> |
| **[C*: Unifying Programming and Verification in C](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02246v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the correct functionality of systems software, given its safety-critical and low-level nature, is a primary focus in formal verification research and applications. Despite advances in verification tooling, conventional programmers are rarely involved in the verification of their own code, resulting in higher development and maintenance costs for verified software. A key barrier to programmer participation in verification practices is the disconnect of environments and paradigms between programming and verification practices, which limits accessibility and real-time verification. We introduce C*, a proof-integrated language design for C programming. C* extends C with verification capabilities, powered by a symbolic execution engine and an LCF-style proof kernel. It enables real-time verification by allowing programmers to embed proof-code blocks alongside implementation code, facilitating interactive updates to the current proof state. Its expressive and extensible proof support allows users to build reusable libraries of logical definitions, theorems, and programmable proof automation. Crucially, C* unifies implementation and proof code development by using C as the common language. We implemented a prototype of C* and evaluated it on a representative benchmark of small C programs and a challenging real-world case study: the attach function of pKVM's buddy allocator. Our results demonstrate that C* supports the verification of a broad subset of C programming idioms and effectively handles complex reasoning tasks in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attacker Control and Bug Prioritization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17740v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As bug-finding methods improve, bug-fixing capabilities are exceeded, resulting in an accumulation of potential vulnerabilities. There is thus a need for efficient and precise bug prioritization based on exploitability. In this work, we explore the notion of control of an attacker over a vulnerability's parameters, which is an often overlooked factor of exploitability. We show that taint as well as straightforward qualitative and quantitative notions of control are not enough to effectively differentiate vulnerabilities. Instead, we propose to focus analysis on feasible value sets, which we call domains of control, in order to better take into account threat models and expert insight. Our new Shrink and Split algorithm efficiently extracts domains of control from path constraints obtained with symbolic execution and renders them in an easily processed, human-readable form. This in turn allows to automatically compute more complex control metrics, such as weighted Quantitative Control, which factors in the varying threat levels of different values. Experiments show that our method is both efficient and precise. In particular, it is the only one able to distinguish between vulnerabilities such as cve-2019-14192 and cve-2022-30552, while revealing a mistake in the human evaluation of cve-2022-30790. The high degree of automation of our tool also brings us closer to a fully-automated evaluation pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 30 figures, USENIX Security 2025</p></details> |

The primary use case for cozy is validating "micropatches": small binary or assembly-level patches inserted into existing compiled binaries. To perform this task, cozy leverages the Python-based angr symbolic execution framework. Our tool analyzes the output of symbolic execution to find end states for the pre- and post-patched binaries that are compatible (reachable from the same input). The tool then compares compatible states for observable differences in registers, memory, and side effects. To aid in usability, cozy comes with a web-based visual interface for viewing comparison results.

| **[Efficient Symbolic Execution of Software under Fault Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15825v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a symbolic method for analyzing the safety of software under fault attacks both accurately and efficiently. Fault attacks leverage physically injected hardware faults to break the safety of a software program. While there are existing methods for analyzing the impact of faults on software, they suffer from inaccurate fault modeling and inefficient analysis algorithms. We propose two new techniques to overcome these problems. First, we propose a fault modeling technique that leverages program transformation to add symbolic variables to the program, to accurately model the fault-induced program behavior. Second, we propose a redundancy pruning technique that leverages the weakest precondition and fault saturation to mitigate path explosion, which is a performance bottleneck of symbolic execution that is exacerbated by the fault-induced program behavior. We have implemented the method and evaluated it on a variety of benchmark programs. The experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method. Specifically, it not only reveals many previously-missed safety violations but also reduces the running time drastically. Compared to the baseline, our optimized method is 2.0$\times$ faster on average.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Static Analysis Techniques for Program Comprehension Using Slicito](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15675v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While program comprehension tools often use static program analysis techniques to obtain useful information, they usually work only with sufficiently scalable techniques with limited precision. A possible improvement of this approach is to let the developer interactively reduce the scope of the code being analyzed and then apply a more precise analysis technique to the reduced scope. This paper presents a new version of the tool SLICITO that allows developers to perform this kind of exploration on C# code in Visual Studio. A common usage of SLICITO is to use interprocedural data-flow analysis to identify the parts of the code most relevant for the given task and then apply symbolic execution to reason about the precise behavior of these parts. Inspired by Moldable Development, SLICITO provides a set of program analysis and visualization building blocks that can be used to create specialized program comprehension tools directly in Visual Studio. We demonstrate the full scope of features on a real industrial example both in the text and in the following video: https://www.slicito.com/icpc2025video.mp4</p></details> |  |

Although gaps can sometimes be narrowed by techniques such as refinement, a verified program's trusted computing base may still include compilers and inlined assembly. In contrast, verification of binaries following an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) such as RISC-V can ensure that machine code behaves as expected on real hardware. While binary analysis is useful and sometimes even necessary for ensuring trustworthiness of software systems, existing tools do not have a formal foundation or lack automation for verification. We present a workflow and toolchain based on the HOL4 theorem prover and the HolBA binary analysis library for trustworthy formal verification of RISC-V binaries. The toolchain automates proofs of binary contracts by forward symbolic execution of programs in HolBA's intermediate language, BIR. We validated our toolchain by verifying correctness of RISC-V binaries with (1) an implementation of the ChaCha20 stream cipher and (2) hand-written assembly for context switching in an operating system kernel.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

High-TVL smart contracts often require complex numerical computations, particularly in mathematical financial models used by many decentralized applications (DApps). Improper calculations can introduce numerical defects, posing potential security risks. Existing research primarily focuses on traditional numerical defects like integer overflow, and there is currently a lack of systematic research and effective detection methods targeting new types of numerical defects. In this paper, we identify five new types of numerical defects through the analysis of 1,199 audit reports by utilizing the open card method. Each defect is defined and illustrated with a code example to highlight its features and potential consequences. We also propose NumScout, a symbolic execution-based tool designed to detect these five defects. Specifically, the tool combines information from source code and bytecode, analyzing key operations such as comparisons and transfers, to effectively locate defects and report them based on predefined detection patterns. Furthermore, NumScout uses a large language model (LLM) to prune functions which are unrelated to numerical operations. This step allows symbolic execution to quickly enter the target function and improve runtime speed by 28.4%. We run NumScout on 6,617 real-world contracts and evaluated its performance based on manually labeled results. We find that 1,774 contracts contained at least one of the five defects, and the tool achieved an overall precision of 89.7%.</p></details> |  |
| **[WakeMint: Detecting Sleepminting Vulnerabilities in NFT Smart Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19032v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The non-fungible tokens (NFTs) market has evolved over the past decade, with NFTs serving as unique digital identifiers on a blockchain that certify ownership and authenticity. However, their high value also attracts attackers who exploit vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts for illegal profits, thereby harming the NFT ecosystem. One notable vulnerability in NFT smart contracts is sleepminting, which allows attackers to illegally transfer others' tokens. Although some research has been conducted on sleepminting, these studies are basically qualitative analyses or based on historical transaction data. There is a lack of understanding from the contract code perspective, which is crucial for identifying such issues and preventing attacks before they occur. To address this gap, in this paper, we categoriz four distinct types of sleepminting in NFT smart contracts. Each type is accompanied by a comprehensive definition and illustrative code examples to provide how these vulnerabilities manifest within the contract code. Furthermore, to help detect the defined defects before the sleepminting problem occurrence, we propose a tool named WakeMint, which is built on a symbolic execution framework and is designed to be compatible with both high and low versions of Solidity. The tool also employs a pruning strategy to shorten the detection period. Additionally, WakeMint gathers some key information, such as the owner of an NFT and emissions of events related to the transfer of the NFT's ownership during symbolic execution. Then, it analyzes the features of the transfer function based on this information so that it can judge the existence of sleepminting. We ran WakeMint on 11,161 real-world NFT smart contracts and evaluated the results. We found 115 instances of sleepminting issues in total, and the precision of our tool is 87.8%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SANER 2025</p></details> |
| **[Computation Tree Logic Guided Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15344v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal logics like Computation Tree Logic (CTL) have been widely used as expressive formalisms to capture rich behavioral specifications. CTL can express properties such as reachability, termination, invariants and responsiveness, which are difficult to test. This paper suggests a mechanism for the automated repair of infinite-state programs guided by CTL properties. Our produced patches avoid the overfitting issue that occurs in test-suite-guided repair, where the repaired code may not pass tests outside the given test suite. To realize this vision, we propose a repair framework based on Datalog, a widely used domain-specific language for program analysis, which readily supports nested fixed-point semantics of CTL via stratified negation. Specifically, our framework encodes the program and CTL properties into Datalog facts and rules and performs the repair by modifying the facts to pass the analysis rules. Previous research proposed a generic repair mechanism for Datalog-based analysis in the form of Symbolic Execution of Datalog (SEDL). However, SEDL only supports positive Datalog, which is insufficient for expressing CTL properties. Thus, we extended SEDL to make it applicable to stratified Datalog. Moreover, liveness property violations involve infinite computations, which we handle via a novel loop summarization. Our approach achieves analysis accuracy of 56.6% on a small-scale benchmark and 88.5% on a real-world benchmark, outperforming the best baseline performances of 27.7% and 76.9%. Our approach repairs all detected bugs, which is not achieved by existing tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Macaw: A Machine Code Toolbox for the Busy Binary Analyst](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06375v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When attempting to understand the behavior of an executable, a binary analyst can make use of many different techniques. These include program slicing, dynamic instrumentation, binary-level rewriting, symbolic execution, and formal verification, all of which can uncover insights into how a piece of machine code behaves. As a result, there is no one-size-fits-all binary analysis tool, so a binary analysis researcher will often combine several different tools. Sometimes, a researcher will even need to design new tools to study problems that existing frameworks are not well equipped to handle. Designing such tools from complete scratch is rarely time- or cost-effective, however, given the scale and complexity of modern ISAs. We present Macaw, a modular framework that makes it possible to rapidly build reliable binary analysis tools across a range of use cases. Statically typed functional programming techniques are used pervasively throughout Macaw -- these range from using functional optimization passes to encoding tricky architectural invariants at the type level to statically check correctness properties. The level of assurance that functional programming ideas afford us allow us to iterate rapidly on Macaw while still having confidence that the underlying semantics are correct. Over a decade of development, we have used Macaw to support an industrial research team in building tools for machine code-related tasks. As such, the name 'Macaw' refers not just to the framework, but also a suite of tools that are built on top of it. We describe Macaw in depth and describe the different static and dynamic analyses that it performs, many powered by an SMT-based symbolic execution engine. We put a particular focus on interoperability between machine code and higher-level languages, including binary lifting from x86 to LLVM, as well verifying the correctness of mixed C and assembly code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compositional Shape Analysis with Shared Abduction and Biabductive Loop Acceleration (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06346v5)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biabduction-based shape analysis is a compositional verification and analysis technique that can prove memory safety in the presence of complex, linked data structures. Despite its usefulness, several open problems persist for this kind of analysis; two of which we address in this paper. On the one hand, the original analysis is path-sensitive but cannot combine safety requirements for related branches. This causes the analysis to require additional soundness checks and decreases the analysis' precision. We extend the underlying symbolic execution and propose a framework for shared abduction where a common pre-condition is maintained for related computation branches. On the other hand, prior implementations lift loop acceleration methods from forward analysis to biabduction analysis by applying them separately on the pre- and post-condition, which can lead to imprecise or even unsound acceleration results that do not form a loop invariant. In contrast, we propose biabductive loop acceleration, which explicitly constructs and checks candidate loop invariants. For this, we also introduce a novel heuristic called shape extrapolation. This heuristic takes advantage of locality in the handling of list-like data structures (which are the most common data structures found in low-level code) and jointly accelerates pre- and post-conditions by extrapolating the related shapes. In addition to making the analysis more precise, our techniques also make biabductive analysis more efficient since they are sound in just one analysis phase. In contrast, prior techniques always require two phases (as the first phase can produce contracts that are unsound and must hence be verified). We experimentally confirm that our techniques improve on prior techniques; both in terms of precision and runtime of the analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 10 figures, 10 listings, accepted at ESOP 2025</p></details> |
| **[SymGPT: Auditing Smart Contracts via Combining Symbolic Execution with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07644v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To govern smart contracts running on Ethereum, multiple Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) standards have been developed, each having a set of rules to guide the behaviors of smart contracts. Violating the ERC rules could cause serious security issues and financial loss, signifying the importance of verifying smart contracts follow ERCs. Today's practices of such verification are to manually audit each single contract, use expert-developed program-analysis tools, or use large language models (LLMs), all of which are far from effective in identifying ERC rule violations. This paper introduces SymGPT, a tool that combines the natural language understanding of large language models (LLMs) with the formal guarantees of symbolic execution to automatically verify smart contracts' compliance with ERC rules. To develop SymGPT, we conduct an empirical study of 132 ERC rules from three widely used ERC standards, examining their content, security implications, and natural language descriptions. Based on this study, we design SymGPT by first instructing an LLM to translate ERC rules into a defined EBNF grammar. We then synthesize constraints from the formalized rules to represent scenarios where violations may occur and use symbolic execution to detect them. Our evaluation shows that SymGPT identifies 5,783 ERC rule violations in 4,000 real-world contracts, including 1,375 violations with clear attack paths for stealing financial assets, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, SymGPT outperforms six automated techniques and a security-expert auditing service, underscoring its superiority over current smart contract analysis methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2404.04306</p></details> |
| **[HyperGo: Probability-based Directed Hybrid Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07815v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed grey-box fuzzing (DGF) is a target-guided fuzzing intended for testing specific targets (e.g., the potential buggy code). Despite numerous techniques proposed to enhance directedness, the existing DGF techniques still face challenges, such as taking into account the difficulty of reaching different basic blocks when designing the fitness metric, and promoting the effectiveness of symbolic execution (SE) when solving the complex constraints in the path to the target. In this paper, we propose a directed hybrid fuzzer called HyperGo. To address the challenges, we introduce the concept of path probability and combine the probability with distance to form an adaptive fitness metric called probability-based distance. By combining the two factors, probability-based distance can adaptively guide DGF toward paths that are closer to the target and have more easy-to-satisfy path constraints. Then, we put forward an Optimized Symbolic Execution Complementary (OSEC) scheme to combine DGF and SE in a complementary manner. The OSEC would prune the unreachable branches and unsolvable branches, and prioritize symbolic execution of the seeds whose paths are closer to the target and have more branches that are difficult to be covered by DGF. We evaluated HyperGo on 2 benchmarks consisting of 21 programs with a total of 100 target sites. The experimental results show that HyperGo achieves 38.47$\times$, 30.89$\times$, 28.52$\times$, 106.09$\times$ and 143.22$\times$ speedup compared to AFLGo, AFLGoSy, BEACON, WindRanger, and ParmeSan, respectively in reaching target sites, and 3.44$\times$, 3.63$\times$, 4.10$\times$, 3.26$\times$, and 3.00$\times$ speedup in exposing known vulnerabilities. Moreover, HyperGo discovered 37 undisclosed vulnerabilities from 7 real-world programs.</p></details> | 16 pages |

One solution for this problem is to partition the state space. A good partitioning enables generalization during learning and more efficient exploitation of prior experiences. Consequently, the learning process becomes faster and produces more reliable policies. However, partitioning introduces approximation, which is particularly harmful in the presence of nonlinear relations between state components. An ideal partition should be as coarse as possible, while capturing the key structure of the state space for the given problem. This work extracts partitions from the environment dynamics by symbolic execution. We show that symbolic partitioning improves state space coverage with respect to environmental behavior and allows reinforcement learning to perform better for sparse rewards. We evaluate symbolic state space partitioning with respect to precision, scalability, learning agent performance and state space coverage for the learnt policies.</p></details> |  |

This isolated approach limits their effectiveness in scenarios where intensive interaction between applications and database systems occurs. To address this gap, we introduce Ultraverse, a what-if analysis framework that seamlessly integrates both application and database layers. Ultraverse employs dynamic symbolic execution to effectively translate application code into compact SQL procedure representations, thereby synchronizing application semantics at both SQL and application levels during what-if replays. A novel aspect of Ultraverse is its use of advanced query dependency analysis, which serves two key purposes: (1) it eliminates the need to replay irrelevant transactions that do not influence the outcome, and (2) it facilitates parallel replay of mutually independent transactions, significantly enhancing the analysis efficiency. Ultraverse is applicable to existing unmodified database systems and legacy application codes. Our extensive evaluations of the framework have demonstrated remarkable improvements in what-if analysis speed, achieving performance gains ranging from 7.7x to 291x across diverse benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGMO...</summary><p>SIGMOD 2025 accepted publication</p></details> |

Different from most dynamic logics that deal with regular expressions or a particular type of formalisms, DLp introduces a type of labels called "program configurations" as explicit program status for symbolic executions, allowing programs and formulas to be of arbitrary forms according to interested domains. This characteristic empowers dynamic logical formulas with a direct support of symbolic-execution-based reasoning, while still maintaining reasoning based on syntactic structures in traditional dynamic logics through a rule-lifting process. We propose a proof system and build a cyclic preproof structure special for DLp, which guarantees the soundness of infinite proof trees induced by symbolically executing programs with explicit/implicit loop structures. The soundness of DLp is formally analyzed and proved. DLp provides a flexible verification framework based on the theories of dynamic logics. It helps reduce the burden of developing different dynamic-logic theories for different programs, and save the additional transformations in the derivations of non-compositional programs. We give some examples of instantiations of DLp in particular domains, showing the potential and advantages of using DLp in practical usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Major...</summary><p>Major revisions from last comments: 1. fix the whole proof system of DLp and its related proofs; 2. add additional two examples for illustrations of lifting processes and an implication of a more complex configuration; 3. further revise the introduction part to adapt these changes; 4. add a formal definition of while programs in the logic</p></details> |
| **[Formally Verified Binary-level Pointer Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17766v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary-level pointer analysis can be of use in symbolic execution, testing, verification, and decompilation of software binaries. In various such contexts, it is crucial that the result is trustworthy, i.e., it can be formally established that the pointer designations are overapproximative. This paper presents an approach to formally proven correct binary-level pointer analysis. A salient property of our approach is that it first generically considers what proof obligations a generic abstract domain for pointer analysis must satisfy. This allows easy instantiation of different domains, varying in precision, while preserving the correctness of the analysis. In the trade-off between scalability and precision, such customization allows "meaningful" precision (sufficiently precise to ensure basic sanity properties, such as that relevant parts of the stack frame are not overwritten during function execution) while also allowing coarse analysis when pointer computations have become too obfuscated during compilation for sound and accurate bounds analysis. We experiment with three different abstract domains with high, medium, and low precision. Evaluation shows that our approach is able to derive designations for memory writes soundly in COTS binaries, in a context-sensitive interprocedural fashion.</p></details> |  |
| **[CUTECat: Concolic Execution for Computational Law](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18212v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many legal computations, including the amount of tax owed by a citizen, whether they are eligible to social benefits, or the wages due to civil state servants, are specified by computational laws. Their application, however, is performed by expert computer programs intended to faithfully transcribe the law into computer code. Bugs in these programs can lead to dramatic societal impact, e.g., paying employees incorrect amounts, or not awarding benefits to families in need. To address this issue, we consider concolic unit testing, a combination of concrete execution with SMT-based symbolic execution, and propose CUTECat, a concolic execution tool targeting implementations of computational laws. Such laws typically follow a pattern where a base case is later refined by many exceptions in following law articles, a pattern that can be formally modeled using default logic. We show how to handle default logic inside a concolic execution tool, and implement our approach in the context of Catala, a recent domain-specific language tailored to implement computational laws. We evaluate CUTECat on several programs, including the Catala implementation of the French housing benefits and Section 132 of the US tax code. We show that CUTECat can successfully generate hundreds of thousands of testcases covering all branches of these bodies of law. Through several heuristics, we improve CUTECat's scalability and usability, making the testcases understandable by lawyers and programmers alike. We believe CUTECat thus paves the way for the use of formal methods during legislative processes.</p></details> |  |

Symbolic execution requires tracking performed computations during software simulation to reason about branches in the software under test. The prevailing approach on symbolic execution of binary code tracks computations by transforming the code to be tested to an architecture-independent IR and then symbolically executes this IR. However, the resulting IR must be semantically equivalent to the binary code, making this process complex and error-prone. The semantics of the binary code are specified by the targeted ISA, commonly given in natural language and requiring a manual implementation of the transformation to an IR. In recent years, the use of formal languages to describe ISA semantics in a machine-readable way has gained increased popularity. We investigate the utilization of such formal semantics for symbolic execution of binary code, achieving an accurate representation of instruction semantics. We present a prototype for the RISC-V ISA and conduct a case study to demonstrate that it can be easily extended to additional instructions. Furthermore, we perform an experimental comparison with prior work which resulted in the discovery of five previously unknown bugs in the ISA implementation of the popular IR-based symbolic executor angr.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the proceedings of the 2025 Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference (DATE'25)</p></details> |

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up new opportunities, given their ability to perform a wide spectrum of tasks. However, the effectiveness of LLM-based approaches compared to traditional techniques such as search-based software testing (SBST) and symbolic execution remains uncertain. In this paper, we perform an extensive study of automatic test generation approaches based on three tools: EvoSuite for SBST, Kex for symbolic execution, and TestSpark for LLM-based test generation. We evaluate tools performance on the GitBug Java dataset and compare them using various execution-based and feature-based metrics. Our results show that while LLM-based test generation is promising, it falls behind traditional methods in terms of coverage. However, it significantly outperforms them in mutation scores, suggesting that LLMs provide a deeper semantic understanding of code. LLM-based approach also performed worse than SBST and symbolic execution-based approaches w.r.t. fault detection capabilities. Additionally, our feature-based analysis shows that all tools are primarily affected by the complexity and internal dependencies of the class under test (CUT), with LLM-based approaches being especially sensitive to the CUT size.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Semantics Lifting for Scientific Computing: A Case Study on FFT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09201v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of automated code generation tools, such as large language models (LLMs), has introduced new challenges in ensuring the correctness and efficiency of scientific software, particularly in complex kernels, where numerical stability, domain-specific optimizations, and precise floating-point arithmetic are critical. We propose a stepwise semantics lifting approach using an extended SPIRAL framework with symbolic execution and theorem proving to statically derive high-level code semantics from LLM-generated kernels. This method establishes a structured path for verifying the source code's correctness via a step-by-step lifting procedure to high-level specification. We conducted preliminary tests on the feasibility of this approach by successfully lifting GPT-generated fast Fourier transform code to high-level specifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Theory and Practice of Static Analysis Workshop (TPSA), in conjunction with the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Finding $\forall\exists$ Hyperbugs using Symbolic Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07918v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many important hyperproperties, such as refinement and generalized non-interference, fall into the class of $\forall\exists$ hyperproperties and require, for each execution trace of a system, the existence of another trace relating to the first one in a certain way. The alternation of quantifiers renders $\forall\exists$ hyperproperties extremely difficult to verify, or even just to test. Indeed, contrary to trace properties, where it suffices to find a single counterexample trace, refuting a $\forall\exists$ hyperproperty requires not only to find a trace, but also a proof that no second trace satisfies the specified relation with the first trace. As a consequence, automated testing of $\forall\exists$ hyperproperties falls out of the scope of existing automated testing tools. In this paper, we present a fully automated approach to detect violations of $\forall\exists$ hyperproperties in software systems. Our approach extends bug-finding techniques based on symbolic execution with support for trace quantification. We provide a prototype implementation of our approach, and demonstrate its effectiveness on a set of challenging examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast, Fine-Grained Equivalence Checking for Neural Decompilers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04811v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural decompilers are machine learning models that reconstruct the source code from an executable program. Critical to the lifecycle of any machine learning model is an evaluation of its effectiveness. However, existing techniques for evaluating neural decompilation models have substantial weaknesses, especially when it comes to showing the correctness of the neural decompiler's predictions. To address this, we introduce codealign, a novel instruction-level code equivalence technique designed for neural decompilers. We provide a formal definition of a relation between equivalent instructions, which we term an equivalence alignment. We show how codealign generates equivalence alignments, then evaluate codealign by comparing it with symbolic execution. Finally, we show how the information codealign provides-which parts of the functions are equivalent and how well the variable names match-is substantially more detailed than existing state-of-the-art evaluation metrics, which report unitless numbers measuring similarity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Verified Lifting of Deep learning Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20992v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning operators are fundamental components of modern deep learning frameworks. With the growing demand for customized operators, it has become increasingly common for developers to create their own. However, designing and implementing operators is complex and error-prone, due to hardware-specific optimizations and the need for numerical stability. There is a pressing need for tools that can summarize the functionality of both existing and user-defined operators. To address this gap, this work introduces a novel framework for the verified lifting of deep learning operators, which synthesizes high-level mathematical formulas from low-level implementations. Our approach combines symbolic execution, syntax-guided synthesis, and SMT-based verification to produce readable and formally verified mathematical formulas. In synthesis, we employ a combination of top-down and bottom-up strategies to explore the vast search space efficiently; In verification, we design invariant synthesis patterns and leverage SMT solvers to validate the correctness of the derived summaries; In simplification, we use egraph-based techniques with custom rules to restore complex formulas to their natural, intuitive forms. Evaluated on a dataset of deep learning operators implemented in Triton from the real world, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of synthesis and verification compared to existing techniques. This framework bridges the gap between low-level implementations and high-level abstractions, improving understanding and reliability in deep learning operator development.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAFT: Efficient Model-Agnostic Fairness Testing for Deep Neural Networks via Zero-Order Gradient Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20086v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown powerful performance in various applications and are increasingly being used in decision-making systems. However, concerns about fairness in DNNs always persist. Some efficient white-box fairness testing methods about individual fairness have been proposed. Nevertheless, the development of black-box methods has stagnated, and the performance of existing methods is far behind that of white-box methods. In this paper, we propose a novel black-box individual fairness testing method called Model-Agnostic Fairness Testing (MAFT). By leveraging MAFT, practitioners can effectively identify and address discrimination in DL models, regardless of the specific algorithm or architecture employed. Our approach adopts lightweight procedures such as gradient estimation and attribute perturbation rather than non-trivial procedures like symbol execution, rendering it significantly more scalable and applicable than existing methods. We demonstrate that MAFT achieves the same effectiveness as state-of-the-art white-box methods whilst improving the applicability to large-scale networks. Compared to existing black-box approaches, our approach demonstrates distinguished performance in discovering fairness violations w.r.t effectiveness (approximately 14.69 times) and efficiency (approximately 32.58 times).</p></details> | Accepted by ICSE24 |
| **[Worst-Case Input Generation for Concurrent Programs under Non-Monotone Resource Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01261v4)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Worst-case input generation aims to automatically generate inputs that exhibit the worst-case performance of programs. It has several applications, and can, for example, detect vulnerabilities to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. However, it is non-trivial to generate worst-case inputs for concurrent programs, particularly for resources like memory where the peak cost depends on how processes are scheduled. This article presents the first sound worst-case input generation algorithm for concurrent programs under non-monotone resource metrics like memory. The key insight is to leverage resource-annotated session types and symbolic execution. Session types describe communication protocols on channels in process calculi. Equipped with resource annotations, resource-annotated session types not only encode cost bounds but also indicate how many resources can be reused and transferred between processes. This information is critical for identifying a worst-case execution path during symbolic execution. The algorithm is sound: if it returns any input, it is guaranteed to be a valid worst-case input. The algorithm is also relatively complete: as long as resource-annotated session types are sufficiently expressive and the background theory for SMT solving is decidable, a worst-case input is guaranteed to be returned. A simple case study of a web server's memory usage demonstrates the utility of the worst-case input generation algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Formal Foundations for Translational Separation Logic Verifiers (extended version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20002v2)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program verification tools are often implemented as front-end translations of an input program into an intermediate verification language (IVL) such as Boogie, GIL, Viper, or Why3. The resulting IVL program is then verified using an existing back-end verifier. A soundness proof for such a translational verifier needs to relate the input program and verification logic to the semantics of the IVL, which in turn needs to be connected with the verification logic implemented in the back-end verifiers. Performing such proofs is challenging due to the large semantic gap between the input and output programs and logics, especially for complex verification logics such as separation logic. This paper presents a formal framework for reasoning about translational separation logic verifiers. At its center is a generic core IVL that captures the essence of different separation logics. We define its operational semantics and formally connect it to two different back-end verifiers, which use symbolic execution and verification condition generation, resp. Crucially, this semantics uses angelic non-determinism to enable the application of different proof search algorithms and heuristics in the back-end verifiers. An axiomatic semantics for the core IVL simplifies reasoning about the front-end translation by performing essential proof steps once and for all in the equivalence proof with the operational semantics rather than for each concrete front-end translation. We illustrate the usefulness of our formal framework by instantiating our core IVL with elements of Viper and connecting it to two Viper back-ends as well as a front-end for concurrent separation logic. All our technical results have been formalized in Isabelle/HOL, including the core IVL and its semantics, the semantics of two back-ends for a subset of Viper, and all proofs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of POPL'25 paper</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Model assisted Hybrid Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15931v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Greybox fuzzing is one of the most popular methods for detecting software vulnerabilities, which conducts a biased random search within the program input space. To enhance its effectiveness in achieving deep coverage of program behaviors, greybox fuzzing is often combined with concolic execution, which performs a path-sensitive search over the domain of program inputs. In hybrid fuzzing, conventional greybox fuzzing is followed by concolic execution in an iterative loop, where reachability roadblocks encountered by greybox fuzzing are tackled by concolic execution. However, such hybrid fuzzing still suffers from difficulties conventionally faced by symbolic execution, such as the need for environment modeling and system call support. In this work, we show how to achieve the effect of concolic execution without having to compute and solve symbolic path constraints. When coverage-based greybox fuzzing reaches a roadblock in terms of reaching certain branches, we conduct a slicing on the execution trace and suggest modifications of the input to reach the relevant branches. A Large Language Model (LLM) is used as a solver to generate the modified input for reaching the desired branches. Compared with both the vanilla greybox fuzzer AFL and hybrid fuzzers Intriguer and Qsym, our LLM-based hybrid fuzzer HyLLfuzz (pronounced "hill fuzz") demonstrates superior coverage. Furthermore, the LLM-based concolic execution in HyLLfuzz takes a time that is 4-19 times faster than the concolic execution running in existing hybrid fuzzing tools. This experience shows that LLMs can be effectively inserted into the iterative loop of hybrid fuzzers, to efficiently expose more program behaviors.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |
| **[LLM Based Input Space Partitioning Testing for Library APIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05456v1)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated library APIs testing is difficult as it requires exploring a vast space of parameter inputs that may involve objects with complex data types. Existing search based approaches, with limited knowledge of relations between object states and program branches, often suffer from the low efficiency issue, i.e., tending to generate invalid inputs. Symbolic execution based approaches can effectively identify such relations, but fail to scale to large programs. In this work, we present an LLM-based input space partitioning testing approach, LISP, for library APIs. The approach leverages LLMs to understand the code of a library API under test and perform input space partitioning based on its understanding and rich common knowledge. Specifically, we provide the signature and code of the API under test to LLMs, with the expectation of obtaining a text description of each input space partition of theAPI under test. Then, we generate inputs through employing the generated text description to sample inputs from each partition, ultimately resulting in test suites that systematically explore the program behavior of the API. We evaluate LISP on more than 2,205 library API methods taken from 10 popular open-source Java libraries (e.g.,apache/commonslang with 2.6k stars, guava with 48.8k stars on GitHub). Our experiment results show that LISP is effective in library API testing. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tool EvoSuite in terms of edge coverage. On average, LISP achieves 67.82% branch coverage, surpassing EvoSuite by 1.21 times. In total, LISP triggers 404 exceptions or errors in the experiments, and discovers 13 previously unknown vulnerabilities during evaluation, which have been assigned CVE IDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures.

| **[Generating executable oracles to check conformance of client code to requirements of JDK Javadocs using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01789v2)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software testing remains the most widely used methodology for validating quality of code. However, effectiveness of testing critically depends on the quality of test suites used. Test cases in a test suite consist of two fundamental parts: (1) input values for the code under test, and (2) correct checks for the outputs it produces. These checks are commonly written as assertions, and termed test oracles. The last couple of decades have seen much progress in automated test input generation, e.g., using fuzzing and symbolic execution. However, automating test oracles remains a relatively less explored problem area. Indeed, a test oracle by its nature requires knowledge of expected behavior, which may only be known to the developer and may not not exist in a formal language that supports automated reasoning. Our focus in this paper is automation of test oracles for clients of widely used Java libraries, e.g., java.lang and java.util packages. Our key insight is that Javadocs that provide a rich source of information can enable automated generation of test oracles. Javadocs of the core Java libraries are fairly detailed documents that contain natural language descriptions of not only how the libraries behave but also how the clients must (not) use them. We use large language models as an enabling technology to embody our insight into a framework for test oracle automation, and evaluate it experimentally. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can generate oracles for checking normal and exceptional behaviors from Javadocs, with 98.8% of these oracles being compilable and 96.4% accurately reflecting intended properties. Even for the few incorrect oracles, errors are minor and can be easily corrected with the help of additional comment information generated by the LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Owi: Performant Parallel Symbolic Execution Made Easy, an Application to WebAssembly](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06391v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present the design of Owi, a symbolic interpreter for WebAssembly written in OCaml, and how we used it to create a state-of-the-art tool to find bugs in programs combining C and Rust code. WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary format for executable programs. Originally intended for web applications, Wasm is also considered a serious alternative for server-side runtimes and embedded systems due to its performance and security benefits. Despite its security guarantees and sandboxing capabilities, Wasm code is still vulnerable to buffer overflows and memory leaks, which can lead to exploits on production software. To help prevent those, different techniques can be used, including symbolic execution. Owi is built around a modular, monadic interpreter capable of both normal and symbolic execution of Wasm programs. Monads have been identified as a way to write modular interpreters since 1995 and this strategy has allowed us to build a robust and performant symbolic execution tool which our evaluation shows to be the best currently available for Wasm. Moreover, because WebAssembly is a compilation target for multiple languages (such as Rust and C), Owi can be used to find bugs in C and Rust code, as well as in codebases mixing the two. We demonstrate this flexibility through illustrative examples and evaluate its scalability via comprehensive experiments using the 2024 Test-Comp benchmarks. Results show that Owi achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art tools like KLEE and Symbiotic, and exhibits advantages in specific scenarios where KLEE's approximations could lead to false negatives.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, since their introduction, WASM smart contracts have been subject to several security incidents caused by contract vulnerabilities, resulting in substantial economic losses. However, existing tools for detecting WASM contract vulnerabilities have accuracy limitations, one of the main reasons being the coarse-grained emulation of the on-chain data APIs. In this paper, we introduce WACANA, an analyzer for WASM contracts that accurately detects vulnerabilities through fine-grained emulation of on-chain data APIs. WACANA precisely simulates both the structure of on-chain data tables and their corresponding API functions, and integrates concrete and symbolic execution within a coverage-guided loop to balance accuracy and efficiency. Evaluations on a vulnerability dataset of 133 contracts show WACANA outperforming state-of-the-art tools in accuracy. Further validation on 5,602 real-world contracts confirms WACANA's practical effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, the authors, who met thanks to Joost-Pieter Katoen, discuss symbolic methods to compute information-theoretic measures of leakage: entropy, conditional entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and mutual information. We build on two semantic frameworks for symbolic execution of probabilistic programs. For discrete programs, we use weakest pre-expectation calculus to compute exact symbolic expressions for the leakage measures. Using Second Order Gaussian Approximation (SOGA), we handle programs that combine discrete and continuous distributions. However, in the SOGA setting, we approximate the exact semantics using Gaussian mixtures and compute bounds for the measures. We demonstrate the use of our methods in two widely used mechanisms to ensure differential privacy: randomized response and the Gaussian mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print of paper appearing in "In Principles of Verification: Cycling the Probabilistic Landscape-Essays Dedicated to Joost-Pieter Katoen on the Occasion of His 60th Birthday, 2024" (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-75783-9_6)</p></details> |

Building on dynamic logic, pDL can express both first-order state properties and probabilistic reachability properties. In this paper, we report on work in progress towards a deductive proof system for pDL. This proof system, in line with verification systems for dynamic logic such as KeY, is based on forward reasoning by means of symbolic execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print of paper appearing in "In Principles of Verification: Cycling the Probabilistic Landscape-Essays Dedicated to Joost-Pieter Katoen on the Occasion of His 60th Birthday, 2024" (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-75783-9_13)</p></details> |
| **[Derivative-Guided Symbolic Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02716v2)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the formulation of a symbolic execution (SE) procedure for functional programs that interact with effectful, opaque libraries. Our procedure allows specifications of libraries and abstract data type (ADT) methods that are expressed in Linear Temporal Logic over Finite Traces (LTLf), interpreting them as symbolic finite automata (SFAs) to enable intelligent specification-guided path exploration in this setting. We apply our technique to facilitate the falsification of complex data structure safety properties in terms of effectful operations made by ADT methods on underlying opaque representation type(s). Specifications naturally characterize admissible traces of temporally-ordered events that ADT methods (and the library methods they depend upon) are allowed to perform. We show how to use these specifications to construct feasible symbolic input states for the corresponding methods, as well as how to encode safety properties in terms of this formalism. More importantly, we incorporate the notion of symbolic derivatives, a mechanism that allows the SE procedure to intelligently underapproximate the set of precondition states it needs to explore, based on the automata structures implicit in the provided specifications and the safety property that is to be falsified. Intuitively, derivatives enable symbolic execution to exploit temporal constraints defined by trace-based specifications to quickly prune unproductive paths and discover feasible error states. Experimental results on a wide-range of challenging ADT implementations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | To appear at POPL'25 |
| **[Detecting Multi-Parameter Constraint Inconsistencies in Python Data Science Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11410v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern AI- and Data-intensive software systems rely heavily on data science and machine learning libraries that provide essential algorithmic implementations and computational frameworks. These libraries expose complex APIs whose correct usage has to follow constraints among multiple interdependent parameters. Developers using these APIs are expected to learn about the constraints through the provided documentations and any discrepancy may lead to unexpected behaviors. However, maintaining correct and consistent multi-parameter constraints in API documentations remains a significant challenge for API compatibility and reliability. To address this challenge, we propose MPDetector, for detecting inconsistencies between code and documentation, specifically focusing on multi-parameter constraints. MPDetector identifies these constraints at the code level by exploring execution paths through symbolic execution and further extracts corresponding constraints from documentation using large language models (LLMs). We propose a customized fuzzy constraint logic to reconcile the unpredictability of LLM outputs and detects logical inconsistencies between the code and documentation constraints. We collected and constructed two datasets from four popular data science libraries and evaluated MPDetector on them. The results demonstrate that MPDetector can effectively detect inconsistency issues with the precision of 92.8%. We further reported 14 detected inconsistency issues to the library developers, who have confirmed 11 issues at the time of writing.</p></details> |  |

Existing LLM-based code translation methods lack training to ensure that the translated code reliably compiles or bears substantial functional equivalence to the input code. In our work, we fine-tune an LLM using reinforcement learning, incorporating compiler feedback, and symbolic execution (symexec)-based testing feedback to assess functional equivalence between the input and output programs. The idea is to guide an LLM during fine-tuning, via compiler and symexec-based testing feedback, by letting it know how far it is from producing perfect translations. We conduct extensive experiments comparing CoTran with 14 other code translation tools, including human-written transpilers, LLM-based translation tools, and ChatGPT. Using a benchmark of over \num{57000} code pairs in Java and Python, we demonstrate that CoTran outperforms the other tools on relevant metrics such as compilation accuracy (CompAcc) and functional equivalence accuracy (FEqAcc). For example, in Python-to-Java translation, CoTran achieves 48.68% FEqAcc and 76.98% CompAcc, whereas the nearest competing tool (PLBART-base) gets 38.26% and 75.77% respectively. Additionally, CoTran, built on top of CodeT5, improves FEqAcc by +14.89% and CompAcc by +8.14% for Python-to-Java (resp., +12.94% and +4.30% for Java-to-Python).</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been published at the 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2024) and is available at https://ebooks.iospress.nl/doi/10.3233/FAIA240968.

| **[Augmenting Interpolation-Based Model Checking with Auxiliary Invariants (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07821v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software model checking is a challenging problem, and generating relevant invariants is a key factor in proving the safety properties of a program. Program invariants can be obtained by various approaches, including lightweight procedures based on data-flow analysis and intensive techniques using Craig interpolation. Although data-flow analysis runs efficiently, it often produces invariants that are too weak to prove the properties. By contrast, interpolation-based approaches build strong invariants from interpolants, but they might not scale well due to expensive interpolation procedures. Invariants can also be injected into model-checking algorithms to assist the analysis. Invariant injection has been studied for many well-known approaches, including k-induction, predicate abstraction, and symbolic execution. We propose an augmented interpolation-based verification algorithm that injects external invariants into interpolation-based model checking (McMillan, 2003), a hardware model-checking algorithm recently adopted for software verification. The auxiliary invariants help prune unreachable states in Craig interpolants and confine the analysis to the reachable parts of a program. We implemented the proposed technique in the verification framework CPAchecker and evaluated it against mature SMT-based methods in CPAchecker as well as other state-of-the-art software verifiers. We found that injecting invariants reduces the number of interpolation queries needed to prove safety properties and improves the run-time efficiency. Consequently, the proposed invariant-injection approach verified difficult tasks that none of its plain version (i.e., without invariants), the invariant generator, or any compared tools could solve.</p></details> |  |
| **[B-Side: Binary-Level Static System Call Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18053v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>System call filtering is widely used to secure programs in multi-tenant environments, and to sandbox applications in modern desktop software deployment and package management systems. Filtering rules are hard to write and maintain manually, hence generating them automatically is essential. To that aim, analysis tools able to identify every system call that can legitimately be invoked by a program are needed. Existing static analysis works lack precision because of a high number of false positives, and/or assume the availability of program/libraries source code -- something unrealistic in many scenarios such as cloud production environments. We present B-Side, a static binary analysis tool able to identify a superset of the system calls that an x86-64 static/dynamic executable may invoke at runtime. B-Side assumes no access to program/libraries sources, and shows a good degree of precision by leveraging symbolic execution, combined with a heuristic to detect system call wrappers, which represent an important source of precision loss in existing works. B-Side also allows to statically detect phases of execution in a program in which different filtering rules can be applied. We validate B-Side and demonstrate its higher precision compared to state-of-the-art works: over a set of popular applications, B-Side's average $F_1$ score is 0.81, vs. 0.31 and 0.53 for competitors. Over 557 static and dynamically-compiled binaries taken from the Debian repositories, B-Side identifies an average of 43 system calls, vs. 271 and 95 for two state-of-the art competitors. We further evaluate the strictness of the phase-based filtering policies that can be obtained with B-Side.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to appear in the 25th ACM/IFIP International Middleware Conference (Middleware'24)</p></details> |
| **[Making Formulog Fast: An Argument for Unconventional Datalog Evaluation (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14017v3)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By combining Datalog, SMT solving, and functional programming, the language Formulog provides an appealing mix of features for implementing SMT-based static analyses (e.g., refinement type checking, symbolic execution) in a natural, declarative way. At the same time, the performance of its custom Datalog solver can be an impediment to using Formulog beyond prototyping -- a common problem for Datalog variants that aspire to solve large problem instances. In this work we speed up Formulog evaluation, with surprising results: while 2.2x speedups are obtained by using the conventional techniques for high-performance Datalog (e.g., compilation, specialized data structures), the big wins come by abandoning the central assumption in modern performant Datalog engines, semi-naive Datalog evaluation. In its place, we develop eager evaluation, a concurrent Datalog evaluation algorithm that explores the logical inference space via a depth-first traversal order. In practice, eager evaluation leads to an advantageous distribution of Formulog's SMT workload to external SMT solvers and improved SMT solving times: our eager evaluation extensions to the Formulog interpreter and Souffl\'e's code generator achieve mean 5.2x and 7.6x speedups, respectively, over the optimized code generated by off-the-shelf Souffl\'e on SMT-heavy Formulog benchmarks. Using compilation and eager evaluation, Formulog implementations of refinement type checking, bottom-up pointer analysis, and symbolic execution achieve speedups on 20 out of 23 benchmarks over previously published, hand-tuned analyses written in F#, Java, and C++, providing strong evidence that Formulog can be the basis of a realistic platform for SMT-based static analysis. Moreover, our experience adds nuance to the conventional wisdom that semi-naive evaluation is the one-size-fits-all best Datalog evaluation algorithm for static analysis workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please cite the official PACMPL version of this article, available at https://doi.org/10.1145/3689754.

| **[Compositional Symbolic Execution for Correctness and Incorrectness Reasoning (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10838v2)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of separation logic has led to the development of symbolic execution techniques and tools that are (functionally) compositional with function specifications that can be used in broader calling contexts. Many of the compositional symbolic execution tools developed in academia and industry have been grounded on a formal foundation, but either the function specifications are not validated with respect to the underlying separation logic of the theory, or there is a large gulf between the theory and the implementation of the tool. We introduce a formal compositional symbolic execution engine which creates and uses function specifications from an underlying separation logic and provides a sound theoretical foundation for, and indeed was partially inspired by, the Gillian symbolic execution platform. This is achieved by providing an axiomatic interface which describes the properties of the consume and produce operations used in the engine to update compositionally the symbolic state, for example when calling function specifications. This consume-produce technique is used by VeriFast, Viper, and Gillian, but has not been previously characterised independently of the tool. As part of our result, we give consume and produce operations inspired by the Gillian implementation that satisfy the properties described by our axiomatic interface. A surprising property is that our engine semantics provides a common foundation for both correctness and incorrectness reasoning, with the difference in the underlying engine only amounting to the choice to use satisfiability or validity. We use this property to extend the Gillian platform, which previously only supported correctness reasoning, with incorrectness reasoning and automatic true bug-finding using incorrectness bi-abduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Python Symbolic Execution with LLM-powered Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09271v1)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic execution is a key technology in software testing, which generates test cases by collecting symbolic path constraints and then solving constraints with SMT solvers. Symbolic execution has been proven helpful in generating high-coverage test cases, but its limitations, e.g., the difficulties in solving path constraints, prevent it from broader usage in software testing. Moreover, symbolic execution has encountered many difficulties when applied to dynamically typed languages like Python, because it is extremely challenging to translate the flexible Python grammar into rigid solvers. To overcome the main challenges of applying symbolic execution in Python, we proposed an LLM-empowered agent, LLM-Sym, that automatically calls an SMT solver, Z3, to solve execution path constraints. Based on an introductory-level symbolic execution engine, our LLM agent can extend it to supporting programs with complex data type `list'. The core contribution of LLM-Sym is translating complex Python path constraints into Z3 code. To enable accurate path-to-Z3 translation, we design a multiple-step code generation pipeline including type inference, retrieval and self-refine. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM-Sym is capable of solving path constraints on Leetcode problems with complicated control flows and list data structures, which is impossible for the backbone symbolic execution engine. Our approach paves the way for the combination of the generation ability of LLMs with the reasoning ability of symbolic solvers, and opens up new opportunities in LLM-augmented test case generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[NSP: A Neuro-Symbolic Natural Language Navigational Planner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06859v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Path planners that can interpret free-form natural language instructions hold promise to automate a wide range of robotics applications. These planners simplify user interactions and enable intuitive control over complex semi-autonomous systems. While existing symbolic approaches offer guarantees on the correctness and efficiency, they struggle to parse free-form natural language inputs. Conversely, neural approaches based on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) can manage natural language inputs but lack performance guarantees. In this paper, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework for path planning from natural language inputs called NSP. The framework leverages the neural reasoning abilities of LLMs to i) craft symbolic representations of the environment and ii) a symbolic path planning algorithm. Next, a solution to the path planning problem is obtained by executing the algorithm on the environment representation. The framework uses a feedback loop from the symbolic execution environment to the neural generation process to self-correct syntax errors and satisfy execution time constraints. We evaluate our neuro-symbolic approach using a benchmark suite with 1500 path-planning problems. The experimental evaluation shows that our neuro-symbolic approach produces 90.1% valid paths that are on average 19-77% shorter than state-of-the-art neural approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, Preprint of paper accepted at 23rd International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA) 2024</p></details> |
| **[WhiteFox: White-Box Compiler Fuzzing Empowered by Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15991v3)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compiler correctness is crucial, as miscompilation can falsify program behaviors, leading to serious consequences. Fuzzing has been studied to uncover compiler defects. However, compiler fuzzing remains challenging: Existing arts focus on black- and grey-box fuzzing, which generates tests without sufficient understanding of internal compiler behaviors. Meanwhile, traditional white-box techniques, like symbolic execution, are computationally inapplicable to the giant codebase of compilers. Recent advances demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in code generation/understanding tasks. Nonetheless, guiding LLMs with compiler source-code information remains a missing piece of research in compiler testing. To this end, we propose WhiteFox, the first white-box compiler fuzzer using LLMs with source-code information to test compiler optimization, with a spotlight on detecting deep logic bugs in the deep learning (DL) compilers. WhiteFox adopts a multi-agent framework: an LLM-based analysis agent examines the low-level optimization source code and produces requirements on the high-level test programs that can trigger the optimization; an LLM-based generation agent produces test programs based on the summarized requirements. Additionally, optimization-triggering tests are used as feedback to enhance the generation on the fly. Our evaluation on the three most popular DL compilers (i.e., PyTorch Inductor, TensorFlow-XLA, and TensorFlow Lite) shows WhiteFox can generate high-quality test programs to exercise deep optimizations, practicing up to 8X more than state-of-the-art fuzzers. WhiteFox has found 101 bugs for the DL compilers, with 92 confirmed as previously unknown and 70 fixed. WhiteFox has been acknowledged by the PyTorch team and is being incorporated into its development workflow. Beyond DL compilers, WhiteFox can also be adapted for compilers in different domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in OOPSLA 2024</p></details> |

CPAchecker is a flexible and configurable framework for software verification and testing. The framework provides many abstract domains, such as BDDs, explicit values, intervals, memory graphs, and predicates, and many program-analysis and model-checking algorithms, such as abstract interpretation, bounded model checking, Impact, interpolation-based model checking, k -induction, PDR, predicate abstraction, and symbolic execution. This tutorial presents basic use cases for CPAchecker in formal software verification, focusing on its main verification techniques with their strengths and weaknesses. It also shows further use cases of CPAchecker for test-case generation and witness-based result validation. The envisioned readers are assumed to possess a background in automatic formal verification and program analysis, but prior knowledge of CPAchecker is not required.

Perhaps due to its success, Ethereum has become a target for various kinds of attacks, motivating researchers to explore different techniques to identify vulnerabilities in EVM bytecode (the language of the Ethereum Virtual Machine), including formal verification, symbolic execution, and fuzz testing. Although recent studies empirically compare smart contract fuzzers, there is a lack of literature investigating how simpler greybox fuzzers compare to more advanced ones. To fill this gap, in this paper, we present DogeFuzz, an extensible infrastructure for fuzzing Ethereum smart contracts, currently supporting black-box fuzzing and two grey-box fuzzing strategies: coverage-guided grey-box fuzzing (DogeFuzz-G) and directed grey-box fuzzing (DogeFuzz-DG). We conduct a series of experiments using benchmarks already available in the literature and compare the DogeFuzz strategies with state-of-the-art fuzzers for smart contracts. Surprisingly, although DogeFuzz does not leverage advanced techniques for improving input generation (such as symbolic execution or machine learning), DogeFuzz outperforms sFuzz and ILF, two state-of-the-art fuzzers. Nonetheless, the Smartian fuzzer shows higher code coverage and bug-finding capabilities than DogeFuzz.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages,published in SBSEG 2024 conference</p></details> |
| **[Program Environment Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13951v3)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer programs are not executed in isolation, but rather interact with the execution environment which drives the program behaviors. Software validation methods thus need to capture the effect of possibly complex environmental interactions. Program environments may come from files, databases, configurations, network sockets, human-user interactions, and more. Conventional approaches for environment capture in symbolic execution and model checking employ environment modeling, which involves manual effort. In this paper, we take a different approach based on an extension of greybox fuzzing. Given a program, we first record all observed environmental interactions at the kernel/user-mode boundary in the form of system calls. Next, we replay the program under the original recorded interactions, but this time with selective mutations applied, in order to get the effect of different program environments -- all without environment modeling. Via repeated (feedback-driven) mutations over a fuzzing campaign, we can search for program environments that induce crashing behaviors. Our EnvFuzz tool found 33 previously unknown bugs in well-known real-world protocol implementations and GUI applications. Many of these are security vulnerabilities and 16 CVEs were assigned.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Existing solutions either adopt path search heuristics to maximize coverage rate or chopped symbolic execution to skip uninteresting code (i.e., manually labeled as vulnerability-unrelated) during path exploration. However, most existing search heuristics are not vulnerability-oriented, and manual labeling of irrelevant code-to-be-skipped relies heavily on prior expert knowledge, making it hard to detect vulnerabilities effectively in practice. This paper proposes Vital, a new vulnerability-oriented symbolic execution via type-unsafe pointer-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). A pointer that is type unsafe cannot be statically proven to be safely dereferenced without memory corruption. Our key hypothesis is that a path with more type unsafe pointers is more likely to contain vulnerabilities. Vital drives a guided MCTS to prioritize paths in the symbolic execution tree that contain a larger number of unsafe pointers and to effectively navigate the exploration-exploitation trade-off. We built Vital on top of KLEE and compared it with existing search strategies and chopped symbolic execution. In the former, the results demonstrate that Vital could cover up to 90.03% more unsafe pointers and detect up to 37.50% more unique memory errors. In the latter, the results show that Vital could achieve a speedup of up to 30x execution time and a reduction of up to 20x memory consumption on automatically detecting known vulnerabilities without prior expert knowledge.</p></details> | 12 pages |

However, vulnerabilities in Wasm binaries could lead to sensitive data leakage and even threaten their hosting environments. To identify them, symbolic execution is widely adopted due to its soundness and the ability to automatically generate exploitations. However, existing symbolic executors for Wasm binaries are typically platform-specific, which means that they cannot support all Wasm features. They may also require significant manual interventions to complete the analysis and suffer from efficiency issues as well. In this paper, we propose an efficient and fully-functional symbolic execution engine, named SeeWasm. Compared with existing tools, we demonstrate that SeeWasm supports full-featured Wasm binaries without further manual intervention, while accelerating the analysis by 2 to 6 times. SeeWasm has been adopted by existing works to identify more than 30 0-day vulnerabilities or security issues in well-known C, Go, and SGX applications after compiling them to Wasm binaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISSTA'24 Demo Track, the tool can be accessed at https://github.com/PKU-ASAL/SeeWasm</p></details> |

| **[Asynchronous Agents with Perfect Recall: Model Reductions, Knowledge-Based Construction, and Model Checking for Coalitional Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06706v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model checking of strategic abilities for agents with memory is a notoriously hard problem, and very few attempts have been made to tackle it. In this paper, we present two important steps towards this goal. First, we take the partial-order reduction scheme that was recently proved to preserve individual and coalitional abilities of memoryless agents, and show that it also works for agents with memory. Secondly, we take the Knowledge-Based Subset Construction, that was recently studied for synchronous concurrent games, and adapt it to preserve abilities of memoryful agents in asynchronous MAS. On the way, we also propose a new execution semantics for strategies in asynchronous MAS, that combines elements of Concurrent Game Structures and Interleaved Interpreted Systems in a natural and intuitive way.</p></details> |  |

In particular, for infinite traces we design a novel symbolic reduction to parity games. We implement both methods in the ATL*AS model checker and evaluate it using synthetic benchmarks as well as a cybersecurity scenario. Our results demonstrate that the symbolic approach significantly outperforms the explicit-state representation and we find that our parity-game-based algorithm offers a more scalable and efficient solution for infinite-trace verification, outperforming previously available tools. Our results also confirm that finite-trace model checking yields substantial performance benefits over infinite-trace verification. As such, we provide a comprehensive toolset for verifying multiagent systems against specifications in ATL*.</p></details> |  |

Our approach is based on encoding the planning problem into a network of timed automata, and then using an efficient model checker on the network followed by a certificate checker to certify the output of the model checker. Our approach prioritises trustworthiness of the certification: we formally verify our implementation of the encoding to timed automata using the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL and we use an existing certificate checker (also formally verified in Isabelle/HOL) to certify the model checking result.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainability Requirements as Hyperproperties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16402v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainability is emerging as a key requirement for autonomous systems. While many works have focused on what constitutes a valid explanation, few have considered formalizing explainability as a system property. In this work, we approach this problem from the perspective of hyperproperties. We start with a combination of three prominent flavors of modal logic and show how they can be used for specifying and verifying counterfactual explainability in multi-agent systems: With Lewis' counterfactuals, linear-time temporal logic, and a knowledge modality, we can reason about whether agents know why a specific observation occurs, i.e., whether that observation is explainable to them. We use this logic to formalize multiple notions of explainability on the system level. We then show how this logic can be embedded into a hyperlogic. Notably, from this analysis we conclude that the model-checking problem of our logic is decidable, which paves the way for the automated verification of explainability requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[An efficient algorithm for $\mathcal{F}$-subgraph-free Edge Deletion on graphs having a product structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14674v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a family $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs, a graph is \emph{$\mathcal{F}$-subgraph-free} if it has no subgraph isomorphic to a member of $\mathcal{F}$. We present a fixed-parameter linear-time algorithm that decides whether a planar graph can be made $\mathcal{F}$-subgraph-free by deleting at most $k$ vertices or $k$ edges, where the parameters are $k$, $\lvert \mathcal{F} \rvert$, and the maximum number of vertices in a member of $\mathcal{F}$. The running time of our algorithm is double-exponential in the parameters, which is faster than the algorithm obtained by applying the first-order model checking result for graphs of bounded twin-width. To obtain this result, we develop a unified framework for designing algorithms for this problem on graphs with a ``product structure.'' Using this framework, we also design algorithms for other graph classes that generalize planar graphs. Specifically, the problem admits a fixed-parameter linear time algorithm on disk graphs of bounded local radius, and a fixed-parameter almost-linear time algorithm on graphs of bounded genus. Finally, we show that our result gives a tight fixed-parameter algorithm in the following sense: Even when $\mathcal{F}$ consists of a single graph $F$ and the input is restricted to planar graphs, it is unlikely to drop any parameters $k$ and $\lvert V(F) \rvert$ while preserving fixed-parameter tractability, unless the Exponential-Time Hypothesis fails.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Verification of Metric Temporal Properties with Past in Pointwise Semantics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14699v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model checking for real-timed systems is a rich and diverse topic. Among the different logics considered, Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) is a powerful and commonly used logic, which can succinctly encode many interesting timed properties especially when past and future modalities are used together. In this work, we develop a new approach for MITL model checking in the pointwise semantics, where our focus is on integrating past and maximizing determinism in the translated automata. Towards this goal, we define synchronous networks of timed automata with shared variables and show that the past fragment of MITL can be translated in linear time to synchronous networks of deterministic timed automata. Moreover determinism can be preserved even when the logic is extended with future modalities at the top-level of the formula. We further extend this approach to the full MITL with past, translating it into networks of generalized timed automata (GTA) with future clocks (which extend timed automata and event clock automata). We present an SCC-based liveness algorithm to analyse GTA. We implement our translation in a prototype tool which handles both finite and infinite timed words and supports past modalities. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in MITL satisfiability checking in pointwise semantics on a benchmark suite of 72 formulas. Finally, we implement an end-to-end model checking algorithm for pointwise semantics and demonstrate its effectiveness on two well-known benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Corresponding analyses sometimes explicitly focus on - and in any case need to take into account - periodic variation, for example by quantifying the activity distribution over the daily cycle or seasonal variation such as migratory behavior. For HMMs including periodic components, we establish important mathematical properties that allow for comprehensive statistical inference related to periodic variation, thereby also providing guidance for model building and model checking. Specifically, we derive the periodically varying unconditional state distribution as well as the time-varying and overall state dwell-time distributions - all of which are of key interest when the inferential focus lies on the dynamics of the state process. We use the associated novel inference and model-checking tools to investigate changes in the diel activity patterns of fruit flies in response to changing light conditions.</p></details> | 23 pages, 13 Figures |
| **[Identifiability and Falsifiability: Two Challenges for Bayesian Model Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14545v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the identifiability of parameters and falsifiability of predictions under the process of model expansion in a Bayesian setting. Identifiability is represented by the closeness of the posterior to the prior distribution and falsifiability by the power of posterior predictive tests against alternatives. To study these two concepts formally, we develop information-theoretic proxies, which we term the identifiability and falsifiability mutual information. We argue that these are useful indicators, with lower values indicating a risk of poor parameter inference and underpowered model checks, respectively. Our main result establishes that a sufficiently complex expansion of a base statistical model forces a trade-off between these two mutual information quantities -- at least one of the two must decrease relative to the base model. We illustrate our result in three worked examples and extract implications for model expansion in practice. In particular, we show as an implication of our result that the negative impacts of model expansion can be limited by offsetting complexity in the likelihood with sufficiently constraining prior distributions.</p></details> | 51 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Synchronous Team Semantics for Temporal Logics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18667v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present team semantics for two of the most important linear and branching time specification languages, Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and Computation Tree Logic (CTL). With team semantics, LTL is able to express hyperproperties, which have in the last decade been identified as a key concept in the verification of information flow properties. We study basic properties of the logic and classify the computational complexity of its satisfiability, path, and model checking problem. Further, we examine how extensions of the basic logic react to adding additional atomic operators. Finally, we compare its expressivity to the one of HyperLTL, another recently introduced logic for hyperproperties. Our results show that LTL with team semantics is a viable alternative to HyperLTL, which complements the expressivity of HyperLTL and has partially better algorithmic properties. For CTL with team semantics, we investigate the computational complexity of the satisfiability and model checking problem. The satisfiability problem is shown to be EXPTIME-complete while we show that model checking is PSPACE-complete.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version with corrected proofs</p></details> |
| **[Parameterized Verification of Timed Networks with Clock Invariants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05190v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider parameterized verification problems for networks of timed automata (TAs) based on different communication primitives. To this end, we first consider disjunctive timed networks (DTNs), i.e., networks of TAs that communicate via location guards that enable a transition only if there is another process in a certain location. We solve for the first time the case with unrestricted clock invariants, and establish that the parameterized model checking problem (PMCP) over finite local traces can be reduced to the corresponding model checking problem on a single TA. Moreover, we prove that the PMCP for networks that communicate via lossy broadcast can be reduced to the PMCP for DTNs. Finally, we show that for networks with k-wise synchronization, and therefore also for timed Petri nets, location reachability can be reduced to location reachability in DTNs. As a consequence we can answer positively the open problem from Abdulla et al.(2018) whether the universal safety problem for timed Petri nets with multiple clocks is decidable.</p></details> | 33 pages, 11 figures |

We focus on the extension of classical propositional logic with the nonemptiness atom NE, a logic known to be both convex and union closed.

The concepts of possible and certain independence are proposed, and first results regarding the axiomatisability and computational complexity of implication problems associated with these concepts are established. In addition, several results for the data and the combined complexity of model checking are presented. The findings help reduce computational overheads associated with the processing of updates and answering of queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[On classes of bounded tree rank, their interpretations, and efficient sparsification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18904v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph classes of bounded tree rank were introduced recently in the context of the model checking problem for first-order logic of graphs. These graph classes are a common generalization of graph classes of bounded degree and bounded treedepth, and they are a special case of graph classes of bounded expansion. We introduce a notion of decomposition for these classes and show that these decompositions can be efficiently computed. Also, a natural extension of our decomposition leads to a new characterization and decomposition for graph classes of bounded expansion (and an efficient algorithm computing this decomposition). We then focus on interpretations of graph classes of bounded tree rank. We give a characterization of graph classes interpretable in graph classes of tree rank $2$. Importantly, our characterization leads to an efficient sparsification procedure: For any graph class $C$ interpretable in a efficiently bounded graph class of tree rank at most $2$, there is a polynomial time algorithm that to any $G \in C$ computes a (sparse) graph $H$ from a fixed graph class of tree rank at most $2$ such that $G = I(H)$ for a fixed interpretation $I$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient "interpretation reversal" result that generalizes the result of Gajarsk\'y et al. [LICS 2016], who showed an analogous result for graph classes interpretable in classes of graphs of bounded degree.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICALP 2024, track B</p></details> |
| **[First Order Logic and Twin-Width in Tournaments and Dense Oriented Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07683v5)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We characterise the classes of tournaments with tractable first-order model checking. For every hereditary class of tournaments $\mathcal T$, first-order model checking is either fixed parameter tractable or $\textrm{AW}[*]$-hard. This dichotomy coincides with the fact that $\mathcal T$ has either bounded or unbounded twin-width, and that the growth of $\mathcal T$ is either at most exponential or at least factorial. From the model-theoretic point of view, we show that NIP classes of tournaments coincide with bounded twin-width. Twin-width is also characterised by three infinite families of obstructions: $\mathcal T$ has bounded twin-width if and only if it excludes at least one tournament from each family. This generalises results of Bonnet et al.\ on ordered graphs. The key for these results is a polynomial time algorithm that takes as input a tournament $T$ and computes a linear order $<$ on $V(T)$ such that the twin-width of the birelation $(T,<)$ is at most some function of the twin-width of $T$. Since approximating twin-width can be done in polynomial time for an ordered structure $(T,<)$, this provides a polynomial time approximation of twin-width for tournaments. Our results extend to oriented graphs with stable sets of bounded size, which may also be augmented by arbitrary binary relations.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 7 figures.

We systematically evaluate this framework on a simplified version of the PlanBench plan verification dataset and report on metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 scores. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT-5 achieves excellent classification performance (F1 score of 96.3%) while almost always producing syntactically perfect formal representations that can act as guarantees. However, the synthesis of semantically perfect formal models remains an area for future exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Representations Through Contrastive Neural Model Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01853v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model checking is a key technique for verifying safety-critical systems against formal specifications, where recent applications of deep learning have shown promise. However, while ubiquitous for vision and language domains, representation learning remains underexplored in formal verification. We introduce Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a novel method that leverages the model checking task as a guiding signal for learning aligned representations. CNML jointly embeds logical specifications and systems into a shared latent space through a self-supervised contrastive objective. On industry-inspired retrieval tasks, CNML considerably outperforms both algorithmic and neural baselines in cross-modal and intra-modal settings. We further show that the learned representations effectively transfer to downstream tasks and generalize to more complex formulas. These findings demonstrate that model checking can serve as an objective for learning representations for formal languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rigorous Evaluation of Microarchitectural Side-Channels with Statistical Model Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02475v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rigorous quantitative evaluation of microarchitectural side channels is challenging for two reasons. First, the processors, attacks, and defenses often exhibit probabilistic behaviors. These probabilistic behaviors arise due to natural noise in systems (e.g., from co-running processes), probabilistic side channel attacks, and probabilistic obfuscation defenses. Second, microprocessors are extremely complex. Previous evaluation methods have relied on abstract or simplified models, which are necessarily less detailed than real systems or cycle-by-cycle simulators, and these models may miss important phenomena. Whereas a simple model may suffice for estimating performance, security issues frequently manifest in the details. We address this challenge by introducing Statistical Model Checking (SMC) to the quantitative evaluation of microarchitectural side channels. SMC is a rigorous statistical technique that can process the results of probabilistic experiments and provide statistical guarantees, and it has been used in computing applications that depend heavily on statistical guarantees (e.g., medical implants, vehicular computing). With SMC, we can treat processors as opaque boxes, and we do not have to abstract or simplify them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMC through three case studies, in which we experimentally show that SMC can evaluate existing security vulnerabilities and defenses and provide qualitatively similar conclusions with greater statistical rigor, while making no simplifying assumptions or abstractions. We also show that SMC can enable a defender to quantify the amount of noise necessary to have a desired level of confidence that she has reduced an attacker's probability of success to less than a desired threshold, thus providing the defender with an actionable plan for obfuscation via noise injection.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches to using MITL in verification tasks, however, have notable drawbacks: they either support only limited fragments of the logic or allow for only incomplete verification. This paper introduces MightyPPL, a new tool for translating formulae in Metric Interval Temporal Logic with Past and Pnueli modalities (MITPPL) over the pointwise semantics into timed automata. MightyPPL enables satisfiability and model checking of a much more expressive specification logic over both finite and infinite words and incorporates a number of performance optimisations, including a novel symbolic encoding of transitions and a symmetry reduction technique that leads to an exponential improvement in the number of reachable discrete states. For a given MITPPL formula, MightyPPL can generate either a network of timed automata or a single timed automaton that is language-equivalent and compatible with multiple verification back-ends, including Uppaal, TChecker, and LTSmin, which supports multi-core model checking. We evaluate the performance of the toolchain across various case studies and configuration options.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time for Timed Monitorability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10008v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring is an important part of the verification toolbox, in particular in situations where exhaustive verification using, e.g., model-checking is infeasible. The goal of online monitoring is to determine the satisfaction or violation of a specification during runtime, i.e., based on finite execution prefixes. However, not every specification is amenable to monitoring, e.g., properties for which no finite execution can witness satisfaction or violation. Monitorability is the question of whether a given specification is amenable to monitoring, and has been extensively studied in discrete time. Here, we study the monitorability problem for real-time properties expressed as Timed Automata. For specifications given by deterministic Timed Muller Automata, we prove decidability while we show that the problem is undecidable for specifications given by nondeterministic Timed B\"uchi automata. Furthermore, we refine monitorability to also determine bounds on the number of events as well as the time that must pass before monitoring the property may yield an informative verdict. We prove that for deterministic Timed Muller automata, such bounds can be effectively computed. In contrast we show that for nondeterministic Timed B\"uchi automata such bounds are not computable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated with corrected proof of Theorem 19, fixing an incorrect characterisation of strong monitorability</p></details> |
| **[AgentGuard: Runtime Verification of AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23864v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution to autonomous, agentic AI systems introduces significant risks due to their inherent unpredictability and emergent behaviors; this also renders traditional verification methods inadequate and necessitates a shift towards probabilistic guarantees where the question is no longer if a system will fail, but the probability of its failure within given constraints. This paper presents AgentGuard, a framework for runtime verification of Agentic AI systems that provides continuous, quantitative assurance through a new paradigm called Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance. AgentGuard operates as an inspection layer that observes an agent's raw I/O and abstracts it into formal events corresponding to transitions in a state model. It then uses online learning to dynamically build and update a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that formally models the agent's emergent behavior. Using probabilistic model checking, the framework then verifies quantitative properties in real-time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2025, in the 1st international workshop on Agentic Software Engineering (AgenticSE)</p></details> |
| **[PAT-Agent: Autoformalization for Model Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23675v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising potential for automating formal methods. However, applying them to formal verification remains challenging due to the complexity of specification languages, the risk of hallucinated output, and the semantic gap between natural language and formal logic. We introduce PAT-Agent, an end-to-end framework for natural language autoformalization and formal model repair that combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with the rigor of formal verification to automate the construction of verifiable formal models. In PAT-Agent, a Planning LLM first extracts key modeling elements and generates a detailed plan using semantic prompts, which then guides a Code Generation LLM to synthesize syntactically correct and semantically faithful formal models. The resulting code is verified using the Process Analysis Toolkit (PAT) model checker against user-specified properties, and when discrepancies occur, a Repair Loop is triggered to iteratively correct the model using counterexamples. To improve flexibility, we built a web-based interface that enables users, particularly non-FM-experts, to describe, customize, and verify system behaviors through user-LLM interactions. Experimental results on 40 systems show that PAT-Agent consistently outperforms baselines, achieving high verification success with superior efficiency. The ablation studies confirm the importance of both planning and repair components, and the user study demonstrates that our interface is accessible and supports effective formal modeling, even for users with limited formal methods experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ASE 2025 (International Conference on Automated Software Engineering)</p></details> |

Representing these instructions as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) enables planners to synthesize actionable plans. We introduce CoT-TL, a data-efficient in-context learning framework for translating natural language specifications into LTL representations. CoT-TL addresses the limitations of large language models, which typically rely on extensive fine-tuning data, by extending chain-of-thought reasoning and semantic roles to align with the requirements of formal logic creation. This approach enhances the transparency and rationale behind LTL generation, fostering user trust. CoT-TL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across three diverse datasets in low-data scenarios, outperforming existing methods without fine-tuning or intermediate translations. To improve reliability and minimize hallucinations, we incorporate model checking to validate the syntax of the generated LTL output. We further demonstrate CoT-TL's effectiveness through ablation studies and evaluations on unseen LTL structures and formulas in a new dataset. Finally, we validate CoT-TL's practicality by integrating it into a QuadCopter for multi-step drone planning based on natural language instructions.

We offer efficient symbolic online monitoring algorithms in a number of settings, exploiting so-called zones well-known from efficient model checking of Timed Automata. Our contributions include a new, much simplified treatment of time divergence and monitoring under timing uncertainty. The online monitoring procedure that handles time divergence, as well as uncertain timing, is implemented in the tool MoniTAal, and shown to effectively monitor properties over long traces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Divide and Conquer based Symbolic Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13478v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern software development, vulnerability detection is crucial due to the inevitability of bugs and vulnerabilities in complex software systems. Effective detection and elimination of these vulnerabilities during the testing phase are essential. Current methods, such as fuzzing, are widely used for this purpose. While fuzzing is efficient in identifying a broad range of bugs and vulnerabilities by using random mutations or generations, it does not guarantee correctness or absence of vulnerabilities. Therefore, non-random methods are preferable for ensuring the safety and security of critical infrastructure and control systems. This paper presents a vulnerability detection approach based on symbolic execution and control flow graph analysis to identify various types of software weaknesses. Our approach employs a divide-and-conquer algorithm to eliminate irrelevant program information, thus accelerating the process and enabling the analysis of larger programs compared to traditional symbolic execution and model checking methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learn, Check, Test -- Security Testing Using Automata Learning and Model Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22215v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems are part of industrial systems and critical infrastructure. Therefore, they should be examined in a comprehensive manner to verify their correctness and security. At the same time, the complexity of such systems demands such examinations to be systematic and, if possible, automated for efficiency and accuracy. A method that can be useful in this context is model checking. However, this requires a model that faithfully represents the behavior of the examined system. Obtaining such a model is not trivial, as many of these systems can be examined only in black box settings due to, e.g., long supply chains or secrecy. We therefore utilize active black box learning techniques to infer behavioral models in the form of Mealy machines of such systems and translate them into a form that can be evaluated using a model checker. To this end, we will investigate a cyber-physical systems as a black box using its external communication interface. We first annotate the model with propositions by mapping context information from the respective protocol to the model using Context-based Proposition Maps (CPMs). We gain annotated Mealy machines that resemble Kripke structures. We then formally define a template, to transfer the structures model checker-compatible format. We further define generic security properties based on basic security requirements. Due to the used CPMs, we can instantiate these properties with a meaningful context to check a specific protocol, which makes the approach flexible and scalable. The gained model can be easily altered to introduce non-deterministic behavior (like timeouts) or faults and examined if the properties still. Lastly, we demonstrate the versatility of the approach by providing case studies of different communication protocols (NFC and UDS), checked with the same tool chain and the same security properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, preprint submitted to Elsevier Computers & Security - Original abstract shortened to comply to the arXiv requirements</p></details> |
| **[Bounded PCTL Model Checking of Large Language Model Outputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18836v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce LLMCHECKER, a model-checking-based verification method to verify the probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) properties of an LLM text generation process. We empirically show that only a limited number of tokens are typically chosen during text generation, which are not always the same. This insight drives the creation of $\alpha$-$k$-bounded text generation, narrowing the focus to the $\alpha$ maximal cumulative probability on the top-$k$ tokens at every step of the text generation process. Our verification method considers an initial string and the subsequent top-$k$ tokens while accommodating diverse text quantification methods, such as evaluating text quality and biases. The threshold $\alpha$ further reduces the selected tokens, only choosing those that exceed or meet it in cumulative probability. LLMCHECKER then allows us to formally verify the PCTL properties of $\alpha$-$k$-bounded LLMs. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in several LLMs, including Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Genstruct, and BERT. To our knowledge, this is the first time PCTL-based model checking has been used to check the consistency of the LLM text generation process.</p></details> | ICTAI 2025 |
| **[NeuS-QA: Grounding Long-Form Video Understanding in Temporal Logic and Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18041v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-Form Video Question Answering (LVQA) poses challenges beyond traditional visual question answering (VQA), which is often limited to static images or short video clips. While current vision-language models (VLMs) perform well in those settings, they struggle with complex queries in LVQA over long videos involving multi-step temporal reasoning and causality. Vanilla approaches, which sample frames uniformly and feed them to a VLM with the question, incur significant token overhead, forcing severe downsampling. As a result, the model often misses fine-grained visual structure, subtle event transitions, or key temporal cues, ultimately leading to incorrect answers. To address these limitations, recent works have explored query-adaptive frame sampling, hierarchical keyframe selection, and agent-based iterative querying. However, these methods remain fundamentally heuristic: they lack explicit temporal representations and cannot enforce or verify logical event relationships. As a result, there are no formal guarantees that the sampled context actually encodes the compositional or causal logic demanded by the question. To address these foundational gaps, we introduce NeuS-QA, a training-free, plug-and-play neuro-symbolic pipeline for LVQA. NeuS-QA translates a natural language question into a formal temporal logic expression, constructs a video automaton from frame-level semantic propositions, and applies model checking to rigorously identify video segments satisfying the question's logical requirements. Only these logic-verified segments are submitted to the VLM, thus improving interpretability, reducing hallucinations, and enabling compositional reasoning without modifying or fine-tuning the model. Experiments on LongVideoBench and CinePile show NeuS-QA improves performance by over 10%, especially on questions involving event ordering, causality, and multi-step compositional reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Checking Continuous Stochastic Logic against Quantum Continuous-Time Markov Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05412v5)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Verifying quantum systems has attracted a lot of interest in the last decades.In this paper, we study the quantitative model-checking of quantum continuous-time Markov chains (quantum CTMCs). The branching-time properties of quantum CTMCs are specified by continuous stochastic logic (CSL), which is well-known for verifying real-time systems, including classical CTMCs. The core of checking the CSL formulas lies in tackling multiphase until formulas. We develop an algebraic method using proper projection, matrix exponentiation, and definite integration to symbolically calculate the probability measures of path formulas. Thus the decidability of CSL is established. To be efficient, numerical methods are incorporated to guarantee that the time complexity is polynomial in the encoding size of the input model and linear in the size of the input formula. A running example of Apollonian networks is further provided to demonstrate our method.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multi-Threaded Software Model Checking via Parallel Trace Abstraction Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13699v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic software verification is a valuable means for software quality assurance. However, automatic verification and in particular software model checking can be time-consuming, which hinders their practical applicability e.g., the use in continuous integration. One solution to address the issue is to reduce the response time of the verification procedure by leveraging today's multi-core CPUs. In this paper, we propose a solution to parallelize trace abstraction, an abstraction-based approach to software model checking. The underlying idea of our approach is to parallelize the abstraction refinement. More concretely, our approach analyzes different traces (syntactic program paths) that could violate the safety property in parallel. We realize our parallelized version of trace abstraction in the verification tool Ulti mate Automizer and perform a thorough evaluation. Our evaluation shows that our parallelization is more effective than sequential trace abstraction and can provide results significantly faster on many time-consuming tasks. Also, our approach is more effective than DSS, a recent parallel approach to abstraction-based software model checking.</p></details> |  |

We summarise the key strands of the underlying theory and technologies that have contributed to these advances, and highlight examples which illustrate the benefits that probabilistic model checking can bring. The aim is to inform potential users of these techniques and to guide future developments in the field.</p></details> |  |

| **[The Complexity of Second-order HyperLTL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15675v6)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We determine the complexity of second-order HyperLTL satisfiability, finite-state satisfiability, and model-checking: All three are equivalent to truth in third-order arithmetic. We also consider two fragments of second-order HyperLTL that have been introduced with the aim to facilitate effective model-checking by restricting the sets one can quantify over. The first one restricts second-order quantification to smallest/largest sets that satisfy a guard while the second one restricts second-order quantification further to least fixed points of (first-order) HyperLTL definable functions. All three problems for the first fragment are still equivalent to truth in third-order arithmetic while satisfiability for the second fragment is $\Sigma_1^2$-complete, and finite-state satisfiability and model-checking are equivalent to truth in second-order arithmetic. Finally, we also introduce closed-world semantics for second-order HyperLTL, where set quantification ranges only over subsets of the model, while set quantification in standard semantics ranges over arbitrary sets of traces. Here, satisfiability for the least fixed point fragment becomes $\Sigma_1^1$-complete, but all other results are unaffected.</p></details> |  |

Layer 2 solutions, such as validity proof Rollups (ZK-Rollups), aim to address these challenges by processing transactions off-chain and validating them on the main chain. However, concerns remain about security and censorship resistance, particularly regarding centralized control in Layer 2 and inadequate mechanisms for enforcing these properties through Layer 1 smart contracts. In their current form, L2s are susceptible to multisig attacks that can lead to total user funds loss. This work presents a formal analysis using the Alloy specification language to examine and design key Layer 2 functionalities, including forced transaction queues, safe blacklisting, and upgradeability. Through this analysis, we identify pitfalls in existing designs and introduce an enhanced model that has been model-checked to be correct. Finally, we propose a complete end-to-end methodology to analyze rollups' security and censorship resistance based on manually translating Alloy properties to property-based testing invariants, setting new standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 2025 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS '25), October 13--17, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan</p></details> |

While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on many reasoning tasks, recent work reveals that their reasoning traces are often unfaithful - serving more as plausible justifications than as causally grounded derivations. Efforts to combine LLMs with symbolic engines (e.g., Prover9, Z3) have improved reliability but remain limited to static forms of logic, struggling with dynamic, state-based reasoning such as multi-step progressions and conditional transitions. In this paper, we propose MCFR (Model Checking for Formal Reasoning), a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates LLMs with model checking to support property verification. MCFR translates natural language into formal specifications and verifies them over transition models. To support evaluation, we introduce EduMC-QA, a benchmark dataset grounded in real academic procedures. Our results show that MCFR improves reasoning faithfulness and interpretability, offering a viable path toward verifiable QA in high-stakes closed-domain applications. In addition to evaluating MCFR, we compare its performance with state-of-the-art LLMs such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude to contextualize its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 2nd ACM Workshop in AI-powered Question & Answering Systems (AIQAM '25), co-located with ACM Multimedia 2025</p></details> |

To address these, we propose a specification-driven development framework. Our method encompasses three key stages. The first stage defines system specifications and invariants using TLA${^+}$. It allows us to perform model checking on the algorithm's correctness and generate test cases for subsequent development phases. In the second stage, based on the established specifications, we write code to ensure consistency and accuracy in the implementation. Finally, after completing the coding process, we rigorously test the system using the test cases generated in the initial stage. This process ensures system quality by maintaining a strong connection between the abstract design and the concrete implementation through continuous verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical Model Checking of NetLogo Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10977v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-based models (ABMs) are gaining increasing traction in several domains, due to their ability to represent complex systems that are not easily expressible with classical mathematical models. This expressivity and richness come at a cost: ABMs can typically be analyzed only through simulation, making their analysis challenging. Specifically, when studying the output of ABMs, the analyst is often confronted with practical questions such as: (i) how many independent replications should be run? (ii) how many initial time steps should be discarded as a warm-up? (iii) after the warm-up, how long should the model run? (iv) what are the right parameter values? Analysts usually resort to rules of thumb and experimentation, which lack statistical rigor. This is mainly because addressing these points takes time, and analysts prefer to spend their limited time improving the model. In this paper, we propose a methodology, drawing on the field of Statistical Model Checking, to automate the process and provide guarantees of statistical rigor for ABMs written in NetLogo, one of the most popular ABM platforms. We discuss MultiVeStA, a tool that dramatically reduces the time and human intervention needed to run statistically rigorous checks on ABM outputs, and introduce its integration with NetLogo. Using two ABMs from the NetLogo library, we showcase MultiVeStA's analysis capabilities for NetLogo ABMs, as well as a novel application to statistically rigorous calibration. Our tool-chain makes it immediate to perform statistical checks with NetLogo models, promoting more rigorous and reliable analyses of ABM outputs.</p></details> |  |

We arrive at the following equally important, interesting new results: We first extend the notions of the {\it probabilistic pushdown systems} and {\it Markov chains} to their quantum analogues and investigate the question of whether it is necessary to define a quantum analogue of {\it probabilistic computational tree logic} to describe the probabilistic and branching-time properties of the {\it quantum Markov chain}. We study its model-checking question and show that model-checking of {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems (qBPA)} against {\it probabilistic computational tree logic (PCTL)} is generally undecidable, i.e., there exists no algorithm for model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} against {\it probabilistic computational tree logic}. We then study in which case there exists an algorithm for model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} and show that the problem of model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} against {\it bounded probabilistic computational tree logic} (bPCTL) is decidable, and further show that this problem is $NP$-hard. Our reduction is from the {\it bounded Post Correspondence Problem} for the first time, a well-known $NP$-complete problem.

| **[On the twin-width of near-regular graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02342v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Twin-width is a recently introduced graph parameter based on the repeated contraction of near-twins. It has shown remarkable utility in algorithmic and structural graph theory, as well as in finite model theory -- particularly since first-order model checking is fixed-parameter tractable when a witness certifying small twin-width is provided. However, the behavior of twin-width in specific graph classes, particularly cubic graphs, remains poorly understood. While cubic graphs are known to have unbounded twin-width, no explicit cubic graph of twin-width greater than 4 is known. This paper explores this phenomenon in regular and near-regular graph classes. We show that extremal graphs of bounded degree and high twin-width are asymmetric, partly explaining their elusiveness. Additionally, we establish bounds for circulant and d-degenerate graphs, and examine strongly regular graphs, which exhibit similar behavior to cubic graphs. Our results include determining the twin-width of Johnson graphs over 2-sets, and cyclic Latin square graphs.</p></details> | 26 pages, 2 figures |

GPS treats the task of model checking a program as a directed search of the program states, guided by a compositional, summary-based static analysis. The summaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible paths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS can find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs that trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that renders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long, input-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense that it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we introduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve refutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked GPS on a diverse suite of benchmarks including programs from the Software Verification Competition (SV-COMP), from prior literature, as well as synthetic programs based on examples in this paper. We found that our implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers (including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in terms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper in OOPSLA 2025 (with typo and stylistic fixes compared to v2 manuscript). 37 pages</p></details> |
| **[Epistemic Skills: Reasoning about Knowledge and Oblivion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01733v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a class of epistemic logics that captures the dynamics of acquiring knowledge and descending into oblivion, while incorporating concepts of group knowledge. The approach is grounded in a system of weighted models, introducing an ``epistemic skills'' metric to represent the epistemic capacities tied to knowledge updates. Within this framework, knowledge acquisition is modeled as a process of upskilling, whereas oblivion is represented as a consequence of downskilling. The framework further enables exploration of ``knowability'' and ``forgettability,'' defined as the potential to gain knowledge through upskilling and to lapse into oblivion through downskilling, respectively. Additionally, it supports a detailed analysis of the distinctions between epistemic de re and de dicto expressions. The computational complexity of the model checking and satisfiability problems is examined, offering insights into their theoretical foundations and practical implications.</p></details> |  |

We enhance this potential by integrating transparency through domain-specific modeling techniques and providing instantaneous, graphical visualizations that accurately represent the semantics of AI-generated code. This approach facilitates visual inspection and formal verification, such as model checking. Formal models can be developed using programming, natural language prompts, voice commands, and stage-wise refinement, with immediate feedback after each transformation step. This support can be tailored to specific domains or intended purposes, improving both code generation and subsequent validation processes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we have developed a prototype as a Visual Studio Code extension for the Lingua Franca language. This prototype showcases the potential for novel domain-specific modeling practices, offering an advancement in how models are created, visualized, and verified.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Task and Motion Planning of Dynamic Systems using Hyperproperties for Signal Temporal Logics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02184v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the task and motion planning problem for dynamical systems under signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. Existing works on STL control synthesis mainly focus on generating plans that satisfy properties over a single executed trajectory. In this work, we consider the planning problem for hyperproperties evaluated over a set of possible trajectories, which naturally arise in information-flow control problems. Specifically, we study discrete-time dynamical systems and employ the recently developed temporal logic HyperSTL as the new objective for planning. To solve this problem, we propose a novel recursive counterexample-guided synthesis approach capable of effectively handling HyperSTL specifications with multiple alternating quantifiers. The proposed method is not only applicable to planning but also extends to HyperSTL model checking for discrete-time dynamical systems. Finally, we present case studies on security-preserving planning and ambiguity-free planning to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HyperSTL planning framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[RNN Generalization to Omega-Regular Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02491v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>B\"uchi automata (BAs) recognize $\omega$-regular languages defined by formal specifications like linear temporal logic (LTL) and are commonly used in the verification of reactive systems. However, BAs face scalability challenges when handling and manipulating complex system behaviors. As neural networks are increasingly used to address these scalability challenges in areas like model checking, investigating their ability to generalize beyond training data becomes necessary. This work presents the first study investigating whether recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can generalize to $\omega$-regular languages derived from LTL formulas. We train RNNs on ultimately periodic $\omega$-word sequences to replicate target BA behavior and evaluate how well they generalize to out-of-distribution sequences. Through experiments on LTL formulas corresponding to deterministic automata of varying structural complexity, from 3 to over 100 states, we show that RNNs achieve high accuracy on their target $\omega$-regular languages when evaluated on sequences up to $8 \times$ longer than training examples, with $92.6\%$ of tasks achieving perfect or near-perfect generalization. These results establish the feasibility of neural approaches for learning complex $\omega$-regular languages, suggesting their potential as components in neurosymbolic verification methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures.

We can do so by directly computing the probability mass of the set of all finite paths from the initial state to G; however, when refining counterexamples, it is also interesting to compute the probability mass of subsets of paths. This can be achieved by splitting the computation into path abstractions that calculate "local" reachability probabilities as shown by \'Abrah\'am et al. in 2010. In this paper, we complete and extend their work: We prove that splitting the computation into path abstractions indeed yields the same result as the direct approach, and that the splitting does not need to follow the SCC structure. In particular, we prove that path abstraction can be performed along any finite sequence of sets of non-goal states. Our proofs proceed in a novel way by interpreting the DTMC as a structure on the free monoid on its state space, which makes them clean and concise. Additionally, we provide a compact reference implementation of path abstraction in PARI/GP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the article "DTMC Model Checking by Path Abstraction Revisited" presented/published at the 19th International Conference on Reachability Problems (RP 2025), 1-3 October 2025, Madrid, Spain (https://rp25.software.imdea.org/)</p></details> |
| **[Data-Driven Abstraction and Synthesis for Stochastic Systems with Unknown Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15543v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the automated abstraction-based synthesis of correct-by-construction control policies for stochastic dynamical systems with unknown dynamics. Our approach is to learn an abstraction from sampled data, which is represented in the form of a finite Markov decision process (MDP). In this paper, we present a data-driven technique for constructing finite-state interval MDP (IMDP) abstractions of stochastic systems with unknown nonlinear dynamics. As a distinguishing and novel feature, our technique only requires (1) noisy state-input-state observations and (2) an upper bound on the system's Lipschitz constant. Combined with standard model-checking techniques, our IMDP abstractions enable the synthesis of policies that satisfy probabilistic temporal properties (such as "reach-while-avoid") with a predefined confidence. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controller synthesis method for multi-agent system based on temporal logic specification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00870v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controller synthesis is a theoretical approach to the systematic design of discrete event systems. It constructs a controller to provide feedback and control to the system, ensuring it meets specified control specifications. Traditional controller synthesis methods often use formal languages to describe control specifications and are mainly oriented towards single-agent and non-probabilistic systems. With the increasing complexity of systems, the control requirements that need to be satisfied also become more complex. Based on this, this paper proposes a controller synthesis method for semi-cooperative semi-competitive multi-agent probabilistic discrete event systems to solve the controller synthesis problem based on temporal logic specifications. The controller can ensure the satisfaction of specifications to a certain extent. The specification is given in the form of a linear temporal logic formula. This paper designs a controller synthesis algorithm that combines probabilistic model checking. Finally, the effectiveness of this method is verified through a case study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Model Checking for Closed-Loop Robot Reactive Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19186v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a new application of model checking which achieves real-time multi-step planning and obstacle avoidance on a real autonomous robot. We have developed a small, purpose-built model checking algorithm which generates plans in situ based on "core" knowledge and attention as found in biological agents. This is achieved in real-time using no pre-computed data on a low-powered device. Our approach is based on chaining temporary control systems which are spawned to counteract disturbances in the local environment that disrupt an autonomous agent from its preferred action (or resting state). A novel discretization of 2D LiDAR data sensitive to bounded variations in the local environment is used. Multi-step planning using model checking by forward depth-first search is applied to cul-de-sac and playground scenarios. Both empirical results and informal proofs of two fundamental properties of our approach demonstrate that model checking can be used to create efficient multi-step plans for local obstacle avoidance, improving on the performance of a reactive agent which can only plan one step. Our approach is an instructional case study for the development of safe, reliable and explainable planning in the context of autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages excluding references, 18 figures, submitted to Formal Aspects of Computing</p></details> |

This work presents a novel approach to use formal verification, specifically Statistical Model Checking (SMC), to verify system properties of autonomous robots at design-time. We introduce an extension of the SCXML format, designed to model system components including both Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) and Behavior Tree (BT) features. Further, we contribute Autonomous Systems to Formal Models (AS2FM), a tool to translate the full system model into JANI. The use of JANI, a standard format for quantitative model checking, enables verification of system properties with off-the-shelf SMC tools. We demonstrate the practical usability of AS2FM both in terms of applicability to real-world autonomous robotic control systems, and in terms of verification runtime scaling. We provide a case study, where we successfully identify problems in a ROS 2-based robotic manipulation use case that is verifiable in less than one second using consumer hardware. Additionally, we compare to the state of the art and demonstrate that our method is more comprehensive in system feature support, and that the verification runtime scales linearly with the size of the model, instead of exponentially.</p></details> | Accepted at IROS2025 |

To enhance the trustworthiness and explainability of model checking tools, we present independently checkable certificates and witnesses for multi-objective {\omega}-regular queries in Markov decision processes. For the certification, we extend and improve existing certificates for the decomposition of maximal end components and reachability properties. We then derive mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) for finding minimal witnessing subsystems. For the special case of Markov chains and LTL properties, we use unambiguous B\"uchi automata to find witnesses, resulting in an algorithm that requires single-exponential space. Existing approaches based on deterministic automata require doubly-exponential space in the worst case. Finally, we consider the practical computation of our certificates and witnesses and provide an implementation of the developed techniques, along with an experimental evaluation, demonstrating the efficacy of our techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has not undergone peer review (when applicable) or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

| **[On Bisimilarity for Quasi-discrete Closure Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11634v5)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Closure spaces, a generalisation of topological spaces, have shown to be a convenient theoretical framework for spatial model checking. The closure operator of closure spaces and quasi-discrete closure spaces induces a notion of neighborhood akin to that of topological spaces that build on open sets. For closure models and quasi-discrete closure models, in this paper we present three notions of bisimilarity that are logically characterised by corresponding modal logics with spatial modalities: (i) CM-bisimilarity for closure models (CMs) is shown to generalise topo-bisimilarity for topological models and to be an instantiation of neighbourhood bisimilarity, when CMs are seen as (augmented) neighbourhood models. CM-bisimilarity corresponds to equivalence with respect to the infinitary modal logic IML that includes the modality ${\cal N}$ for ``being near to''. (ii) CMC-bisimilarity, with `CMC' standing for CM-bisimilarity with converse, refines CM-bisimilarity for quasi-discrete closure spaces, carriers of quasi-discrete closure models. Quasi-discrete closure models come equipped with two closure operators, Direct ${\cal C}$ and Converse ${\cal C}$, stemming from the binary relation underlying closure and its converse. CMC-bisimilarity, is captured by the infinitary modal logic IMLC including two modalities, Direct ${\cal N}$ and Converse ${\cal N}$, corresponding to the two closure operators. (iii) CoPa-bisimilarity on quasi-discrete closure models, which is weaker than CMC-bisimilarity, is based on the notion of compatible paths. The logical counterpart of CoPa-bisimilarity is the infinitary modal logic ICRL with modalities Direct $\zeta$ and Converse $\zeta$, whose semantics relies on forward and backward paths, respectively. It is shown that CoPa-bisimilarity for quasi-discrete closure models relates to divergence-blind stuttering equivalence for Kripke models.</p></details> |  |
| **[HoarePrompt: Structural Reasoning About Program Correctness in Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19599v2)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While software requirements are often expressed in natural language, verifying the correctness of a program against such requirements is a hard and underexplored problem. Large language models (LLMs) are promising candidates for addressing this challenge, however our experience shows that they are ineffective in this task, often failing to detect even straightforward bugs. To address this gap, we introduce HoarePrompt, a novel approach that adapts fundamental ideas from program verification to natural language artifacts. Inspired from the strongest postcondition calculus, HoarePrompt employs a systematic, step-by-step process in which an LLM generates natural language descriptions of reachable program states at various code points. To manage loops, we propose few-shot-driven k-induction, an adaptation of the k-induction method widely used in model checking. Once program states are described, HoarePrompt leverages the LLM to assess whether the program, annotated with these state descriptions, conforms to the natural language requirements. For evaluating the quality of classifiers of program correctness with respect to natural language requirements, we constructed CoCoClaNeL, a challenging dataset of solutions to programming competition problems. Our experiments show that HoarePrompt improves the MCC by 61% compared to directly using Zero-shot-CoT prompts for correctness classification. Furthermore, HoarePrompt outperforms a classifier that assesses correctness via LLM-based test generation by an MCC increase of 106%. The inductive reasoning mechanism contributes a 26% boost to MCC, underscoring its effectiveness in managing loops.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disjunctions of Two Dependence Atoms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16146v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dependence logic is a formalism that augments the syntax of first-order logic with dependence atoms asserting that the value of a variable is determined by the values of some other variables, i.e., dependence atoms express functional dependencies in relational databases. On finite structures, dependence logic captures NP, hence there are sentences of dependence logic whose model-checking problem is NP-complete. In fact, it is known that there are disjunctions of three dependence atoms whose model-checking problem is NP-complete. Motivated from considerations in database theory, we study the model-checking problem for disjunctions of two unary dependence atoms and establish a trichotomy theorem, namely, for every such formula, one of the following is true for the model-checking problem: (i) it is NL-complete; (ii) it is LOGSPACE-complete; (iii) it is first-order definable (hence, in AC[0]). Furthermore, we classify the complexity of the model-checking problem for disjunctions of two arbitrary dependence atoms, and also characterize when such a disjunction is coherent, i.e., when it satisfies a certain small-model property. Along the way, we identify a new class of 2CNF-formulas whose satisfiability problem is LOGSPACE-complete.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-Aware Computing, Partial Quantifier Elimination And SAT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05928v7)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtually all efficient algorithms of hardware verification are somewhat formula-specific i.e, try to take into account the structure of the formula at hand. So, those algorithms can be viewed as $\mathit{structure}$-$\mathit{aware}$ $\mathit{computing}$ (SAC). We relate SAC and $\mathit{partial}$ $\mathit{quantifier}$ $\mathit{elimination}$ (PQE), a generalization of regular quantifier elimination. In PQE, one can take a $\mathit{part}$ of the formula out of the scope of quantifiers. Interpolation can be viewed as a special case of PQE. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, we want to show that new powerful methods of SAC can be formulated in terms of PQE. We use three hardware verification problems (testing by property generation, equivalence checking and model checking) to explain how SAC is performed by PQE. Second, we want to demonstrate that PQE solving itself can benefit from SAC. To this end, we describe a new SAT procedure based on SAC and then use it to introduce a structure-aware PQE algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Their expressive power is intimately related to logics that are invariant under graded bisimilarity. Current proposals for recurrent GNNs either assume that the graph size is given to the model, or suffer from a lack of termination guarantees. In this paper, we propose a halting mechanism for recurrent GNNs. We prove that our halting model can express all node classifiers definable in graded modal mu-calculus, even for the standard GNN variant that is oblivious to the graph size. To prove our main result, we develop a new approximate semantics for graded mu-calculus, which we believe to be of independent interest. We leverage this new semantics into a new model-checking algorithm, called the counting algorithm, which is oblivious to the graph size. In a final step we show that the counting algorithm can be implemented on a halting recurrent GNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended technical report of paper accepted for publication at KR 2025</p></details> |

In contrast, programmers working in languages such as C benefit from mature model checkers, for example CBMC, which enable exhaustive symbolic reasoning and fault localisation. The inherent complexity of Python, coupled with the verbosity and low-level nature of existing transpilers (e.g., Cython), have historically limited the applicability of formal verification to Python programs. In this paper, we propose PyVeritas, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for high-level transpilation from Python to C, followed by bounded model checking and MaxSAT-based fault localisation in the generated C code. PyVeritas enables verification and bug localisation for Python code using existing model checking tools for C. Our empirical evaluation on two Python benchmarks demonstrates that LLM-based transpilation can achieve a high degree of accuracy, up to 80--90% for some LLMs, enabling effective development environment that supports assertion-based verification and interpretable fault diagnosis for small yet non-trivial Python programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

However, BVI may not terminate or converge when the target SG contains end components. Most existing approaches address this issue by explicitly detecting and processing end components--a process that is often computationally expensive. An exception is the widest path-based BVI approach previously studied by Phalakarn et al., which we refer to as 1WP-BVI. The method performs particularly well in the presence of numerous end components. Nonetheless, its theoretical foundations remain somewhat ad hoc. In this paper, we identify and formalize the core principles underlying the widest path-based BVI approach by (i) presenting 2WP-BVI, a clean BVI algorithm based on (2-player) widest path games, and (ii) proving its correctness using what we call the maximality inheritance principle--a proof principle previously employed in a well-known result in probabilistic model checking. Our experimental results demonstrate the practical relevance and potential of our proposed 2WP-BVI algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Parameter Lifting: Finer Abstractions for Parametric Markov Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05965v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parametric Markov chains (pMCs) are Markov chains (MCs) with symbolic probabilities. A pMC encodes a family of MCs, where each member is obtained by replacing parameters with constants. The parameters allow encoding dependencies between transitions, which sets pMCs apart from interval MCs. The verification problem for pMCs asks whether each MC in the corresponding family satisfies a given temporal specification. The state-of-the-art approach for this problem is parameter lifting (PL) -- an abstraction-refinement loop that abstracts the pMC to a non-parametric model analyzed with standard probabilistic model checking techniques. This paper presents two key improvements to tackle the main limitations of PL. First, we introduce generalized parameter lifting (GPL) to lift various restrictive assumptions made by PL. Second, we present a big-step transformation algorithm that reduces parameter dependencies in pMCs and, therefore, results in tighter approximations. Experiments show that GPL is widely applicable and that the big-step transformation accelerates pMC verification by up to orders of magnitude.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ATVA 2025</p></details> |

Fault tree analysis is a widespread method used for risk assessment of these systems: fault trees (FTs) are required by, e.g., the Federal Aviation Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In spite of their popularity, little work has been done on formulating structural queries about FT and analyzing these, e.g., when evaluating potential scenarios, and to give practitioners instruments to formulate queries on FTs in an understandable yet powerful way. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by extending BFL [32], a logic that reasons about Boolean FTs. To do so, we introduce a Probabilistic Fault tree Logic (PFL). PFL is a simple, yet expressive logic that supports easier formulation of complex scenarios and specification of FT properties that comprise probabilities. Alongside PFL, we present LangPFL, a domain specific language to further ease property specification. We showcase PFL and LangPFL by applying them to a COVID-19 related FT and to a FT for an oil/gas pipeline. Finally, we present theory and model checking algorithms based on binary decision diagrams (BDDs).</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2208.13424</p></details> |
| **[Pro2Guard: Proactive Runtime Enforcement of LLM Agent Safety via Probabilistic Model Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00500v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit powerful autonomous capabilities across domains such as robotics, virtual assistants, and web automation. However, their stochastic behavior introduces significant safety risks that are difficult to anticipate. Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as AgentSpec, focus on developing reactive safety rules, which typically respond only when unsafe behavior is imminent or has already occurred. These systems lack foresight and struggle with long-horizon dependencies and distribution shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime enforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis. Pro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces. At runtime, it anticipates future risks by estimating the probability of reaching unsafe states, triggering interventions before violations occur when the predicted risk exceeds a user-defined threshold. By incorporating semantic validity checks and leveraging PAC bounds, Pro2Guard ensures statistical reliability while approximating the underlying ground-truth model. We evaluate Pro2Guard extensively across two safety-critical domains: embodied household agents and autonomous vehicles. In embodied agent tasks, Pro2Guard enforces safety early on up to 93.6% of unsafe tasks using low thresholds, while configurable modes (e.g., reflect) allow balancing safety with task success, maintaining up to 80.4% task completion. In autonomous driving scenarios, Pro2Guard achieves 100% prediction of traffic law violations and collisions, anticipating risks up to 38.66 seconds ahead.</p></details> |  |

While the classical model-checking algorithm for full HyperLTL is automata-theoretic, more recently, a game-based alternative for the $\forall^*\exists^*$-fragment has been presented. Here, we employ imperfect information-games to extend the game-based approach to full HyperQPTL, which features arbitrary quantifier prefixes and quantification over propositions and can express every $\omega$-regular hyperproperty. As a byproduct of our game-based algorithm, we obtain finite-state implementations of Skolem functions via transducers with lookahead that explain satisfaction or violation of HyperQPTL properties.</p></details> |  |

Probabilistic model checking is a powerful tool for providing guarantees on stochastic models of systems. However, constructing model-checkable models of black-box perception components for system-level mathematical guarantees has been an enduring challenge. In this paper, we propose a method for constructing provably conservative Interval Markov Decision Process (IMDP) models of closed-loop systems with perception components. We prove that our technique results in conservative abstractions with a user-specified probability. We evaluate our approach in an automatic braking case study using both a synthetic perception component and the object detector YOLO11 in the CARLA driving simulator.</p></details> |  |

Online monitoring and active testing of embedded real-time systems can then be achieved by symbolic execution of such automata on the trace observed from the system. This direct construction however only is faithful if observation of the trace is immediate in the sense that the monitor (or test harness, respectively) can assign exact time stamps to the actions it observes, which is rarely true in practice due to the substantial and fluctuating parametric delays introduced by the circuitry connecting the observed system to its monitoring or testing device. We present purely zone-based online monitoring and testing algorithms, which handle such parametric delays exactly without recurrence to costly verification procedures for parametric timed automata. We have implemented our algorithms on top of the real-time model checking tool UPPAAL, and report on encouraging initial results.</p></details> |  |

We also develop algorithms for solving membership and emptiness for the languages of trees accepted by EU-automata. We then use EU-automata to obtain several algorithmic and expressiveness results for the temporal logic QCTL (which extends CTL with quantification over atomic propositions) and for MSO. On the one hand, we obtain decision procedures with optimal complexity for QCTL satisfiability and model checking; on the other hand, we obtain an algorithm for translating any QCTL formula with k quantifier alternations to formulas with at most one quantifier alternation, at the expense of a $(k + 1)$-exponential blow-up in the size of the formulas. Using the same techniques, we prove that any MSO formula can be translated into a formula with at most four quantifier alternations (and only one second-order-quantifier alternation), this time with a $(k + 2)$-exponential blow-up in the size of the formula.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Model Checking in Graphs Classes of Bounded Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14825v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sparsity theory of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez provides generic combinatorial and algorithmic methods suitable for many classes of sparse graphs. As such, it has already driven major advances in model checking, parameterized complexity, and approximation algorithms. We show that this theory is equally well suited to the design of distributed algorithms, providing the first generic algorithmic results for distributed first-order (FO) model checking on graphs of bounded expansion. The latter form a rich graph family which subsumes planar, bounded-genus, bounded-treewidth, and bounded-degree graphs, as well as graphs excluding a fixed minor or topological minor, and sparse Erdos-R\'enyi graphs (a.a.s). Our main results are the following algorithmic meta-theorems for distributed algorithms in the standard CONGEST model on every graph class $\mathcal{G}$ of bounded expansion. First, we resolve an open problem originally posed by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez (Distributed Computing 2016), and reiterated by Pilipczuk, Siebertz, and Toru\'nczyk (LICS 2018). A formula $\varphi(x)$ is local if the satisfaction of $\varphi(x)$ depends only on the $r$-neighbourhood of its free variable $x$, for some fixed $r$. For instance, the formula '$x$ belongs to a triangle' is local. We show that, for every local FO formula $\varphi(x)$, there exists a deterministic algorithm that, for every $n$-vertex graph $G\in \mathcal{G}$, identifies all vertices $v\in V(G)$ such that $G\models \varphi(v)$, in $O(\log n)$ rounds. Second, we show that, for every FO formula $\varphi$, there is a deterministic algorithm that, for every $n$-vertex graph $G\in \mathcal{G}$, decides whether $G\models \varphi$, in $\mathcal{O}(D+\log n)$ rounds, where $D$ is the diameter of $G$. The techniques extend to distributed counting, optimization, and certification problems.</p></details> |  |

Traditional computational methods often fall short, leading to delayed and sometimes ineffective diagnoses and treatments. Quantum Computing (QC) and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offer transformative advancements with the potential to revolutionize medicine. This paper summarizes areas where QC promises unprecedented computational power, enabling faster, more accurate diagnostics, personalized treatments, and enhanced drug discovery processes. However, integrating quantum technologies into precision medicine also presents challenges, including errors in algorithms and high costs. We show that mathematically-based techniques for specifying, developing, and verifying software (formal methods) can enhance the reliability and correctness of QC. By providing a rigorous mathematical framework, formal methods help to specify, develop, and verify systems with high precision. In genomic data analysis, formal specification languages can precisely (1) define the behavior and properties of quantum algorithms designed to identify genetic markers associated with diseases. Model checking tools can systematically explore all possible states of the algorithm to (2) ensure it behaves correctly under all conditions, while theorem proving techniques provide mathematical (3) proof that the algorithm meets its specified properties, ensuring accuracy and reliability. Additionally, formal optimization techniques can (4) enhance the efficiency and performance of quantum algorithms by reducing resource usage, such as the number of qubits and gate operations. Therefore, we posit that formal methods can significantly contribute to enabling QC to realize its full potential as a game changer in precision medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>prese...</summary><p>presented at AISoLA 2024</p></details> |
| **[Reasoning about Rare-Event Reachability in Stochastic Vector Addition Systems via Affine Vector Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17711v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rare events in Stochastic Vector Addition System (VAS) are of significant interest because, while extremely unlikely, they may represent undesirable behavior that can have adverse effects. Their low probabilities and potentially extremely large state spaces challenge existing probabilistic model checking and stochastic rare-event simulation techniques. In particular, in Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs), a chemical kinetic language often represented as VAS, rare event effects may be pathological. We present two novel heuristics for priority-first partial state space expansion and trace generation tuned to the transient analysis of rare-event probability in VAS: Iterative Subspace Reduction (ISR) and Single Distance Priority (SDP). Both methods construct a closed vector space containing all solution states. SDP then simply prioritizes shorter distances to this ``solution space'', while ISR constructs a set of nested subspaces, where short and highly-probable satisfying traces are likely to pass through in sequence. The resulting partial state graph from each method contains likely traces to rare-event states, allowing efficient probabilistic model checking to compute a lower-bound probability of a rare event of interest. These methods are deterministic, fast, and demonstrate marked performance on challenging CRN models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous Composition of LTL Properties over Infinite and Finite Traces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14831v3)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The verification of asynchronous software components poses significant challenges due to the way components interleave and exchange input/output data concurrently. Compositional strategies aim to address this by separating the task of verifying individual components on local properties from the task of combining them to achieve global properties. This paper concentrates on employing symbolic model checking techniques to verify properties specified in Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL) on asynchronous software components that interact through data ports. Unlike event-based composition, local properties can now impose constraints on input from other components, increasing the complexity of their composition. We consider both the standard semantics over infinite traces as well as the truncated semantics over finite traces to allow scheduling components only finitely many times. We propose a novel LTL rewriting approach, which converts a local property into a global one while considering the interleaving of infinite or finite execution traces of components. We prove the semantic equivalence of local properties and their rewritten version projected on the local symbols. The rewriting is also optimized to reduce formula size and to leave it unchanged when the temporal property is stutter invariant. These methods have been integrated into the OCRA tool, as part of the contract refinement verification suite. Finally, the different composition approaches were compared through an experimental evaluation that covers various types of specifications.</p></details> |  |

We look at algorithms where communication is via shared read/write registers, where those registers can be atomic or non-atomic. For the verification of liveness properties, it is necessary to assume a completeness criterion to eliminate spurious counterexamples. We use justness as completeness criterion. Justness depends on a concurrency relation; we consider several such relations, modelling different assumptions on the working of the shared registers. We present executions demonstrating the violation of correctness properties by several algorithms, and in some cases suggest improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ab...</summary><p>An abbreviated version of this paper will appear in Proc.

| **[Tailored Quantum Device Calibration with Statistical Model Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12323v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum devices require precisely calibrated analog signals, a process that is complex and time-consuming. Many calibration strategies exist, and all require careful analysis and tuning to optimize system availability. To enable rigorous statistical evaluation of quantum calibration procedures, we leverage statistical model checking (SMC), a technique used in fields that require statistical guarantees. SMC allows for probabilistic evaluation of properties of interest, such as a certain parameter's time to failure. We extend the SMC for Processor Analysis (SPA) framework, which uses SMC for evaluation of classical systems, to create SPA for Quantum calibration (SPAQ) enabling simplified tuning and analysis of quantum system calibration. We focus on a directed acyclic graph-based calibration optimization scheme and demonstrate how to craft properties of interest for its analysis. We show how to use SPAQ to find lower bounds of time to failure information, hidden node dependencies, and parameter threshold values and use that information to improve simulated quantum system availability through calibration scheme adjustments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Safety Verification for an Autonomous Ground Vehicle: A Situation Coverage Grid Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12158v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As industrial autonomous ground vehicles are increasingly deployed in safety-critical environments, ensuring their safe operation under diverse conditions is paramount. This paper presents a novel approach for their safety verification based on systematic situation extraction, probabilistic modelling and verification. We build upon the concept of a situation coverage grid, which exhaustively enumerates environmental configurations relevant to the vehicle's operation. This grid is augmented with quantitative probabilistic data collected from situation-based system testing, capturing probabilistic transitions between situations. We then generate a probabilistic model that encodes the dynamics of both normal and unsafe system behaviour. Safety properties extracted from hazard analysis and formalised in temporal logic are verified through probabilistic model checking against this model. The results demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies high-risk situations, provides quantitative safety guarantees, and supports compliance with regulatory standards, thereby contributing to the robust deployment of autonomous systems.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

In this paper, we detail the formal modelling, verification and testing of {\tt CARE}. We provide a formalisation as a network of stochastic timed automata. The model is verified against the desired properties with the tool {\sc Uppaal}, utilising exhaustive and statistical model checking techniques. Abstract tests are generated from the {\sc Uppaal} models that are concretised for testing {\tt CARE}. This research emphasises the advantages of employing formal modelling, verification and testing processes to enhance the dependability of an open-source distributed application. We discuss the methodology used for modelling the application and generating concrete tests from the abstract model, addressing the issues that have been identified and fixed.</p></details> |  |
| **[AssertCoder: LLM-Based Assertion Generation via Multimodal Specification Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10338v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assertion-Based Verification (ABV) is critical for ensuring functional correctness in modern hardware systems. However, manually writing high-quality SVAs remains labor-intensive and error-prone. To bridge this gap, we propose AssertCoder, a novel unified framework that automatically generates high-quality SVAs directly from multimodal hardware design specifications. AssertCoder employs a modality-sensitive preprocessing to parse heterogeneous specification formats (text, tables, diagrams, and formulas), followed by a set of dedicated semantic analyzers that extract structured representations aligned with signal-level semantics. These representations are utilized to drive assertion synthesis via multi-step chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. The framework incorporates a mutation-based evaluation approach to assess assertion quality via model checking and further refine the generated assertions. Experimental evaluation across three real-world Register-Transfer Level (RTL) designs demonstrates AssertCoder's superior performance, achieving an average increase of 8.4% in functional correctness and 5.8% in mutation detection compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Bounded Model Checking of RISC-V Machine Code with Context-Free-Language Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09539v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for analyzing the behavior of software yet scalability remains a challenge due to state explosion in control and data flow. Existing tools typically aim at managing control flow internally, often at the expense of completeness, while offloading reasoning over data flow to SMT solvers. Moreover, reasoning typically happens on source code or intermediate representation level to leverage structural information, making machine code generation part of the trust base. We are interested in changing the equation in two non-trivial ways: pushing reasoning down to machine code level, and then offloading reasoning entirely into SMT solvers and other, possibly more efficient solver technology. In more abstract terms, we are asking if bit-precise reasoning technology can be made scalable on software, and not just hardware. For this purpose, we developed two tools called rotor and bitme for model generation and bounded model checking, respectively. We chose RISC-V restricted to integer arithmetic as modeling target for rotor since RISC-V integer semantics is essentially equivalent to established SMT semantics over bitvectors and arrays of bitvectors. While state-of-the-art SMT solvers struggle in our experiments, we have evidence that there is potential for improvement. To show the potential, we have slightly generalized and then implemented in bitme two types of binary decision diagrams (BDDs): algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs) and context-free-language ordered binary decision diagrams (CFLOBDDs). Bitme uses BDDs to propagate program input through models, essentially generalizing constant propagation to domain propagation. SMT solvers only get involved when model input cannot be propagated, significanly speeding up SMT solving. We then study the impact on state explosion of CFLOBDDs, which are potentially more scalable than ADDs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probability-Raising Causality for Uncertain Parametric Markov Decision Processes with PAC Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07319v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent decision-making systems are increasingly complicated, making it crucial to verify and understand their behavior for a given specification. A promising approach is to comprehensively explain undesired behavior in the systems modeled by Markov decision processes (MDPs) through formal verification and causal reasoning. However, the reliable explanation using model-based probabilistic causal analysis has not been explored when the MDP's transition probabilities are uncertain. This paper proposes a method to identify potential causes of undesired behaviors in an uncertain parametric MDP (upMDP) using parameter sampling, model checking, and a set covering for the samples. A cause is defined as a subset of states based on a probability-raising principle. We show that the probability of each identified subset being a cause exceeds a specified threshold. Further, a lower bound of the probability that the undesired paths visit the subsets is maximized as much as possible while satisfying a nonredundancy condition. While computing these probabilities is complicated, this study derives probabilistically approximately correct lower bounds of both probabilities by the sampling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through a path-planning scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 41st Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Tool for Supporting Debugging and Understanding of Normative Requirements Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05504v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Normative requirements specify social, legal, ethical, empathetic, and cultural (SLEEC) norms that must be observed by a system. To support the identification of SLEEC requirements, numerous standards and regulations have been developed. These requirements are typically defined by stakeholders in the non-technical system with diverse expertise (e.g., ethicists, lawyers, social scientists). Hence, ensuring their consistency and managing the requirement elicitation process are complex and error-prone tasks. Recent research has addressed this challenge using domain-specific languages to specify normative requirements as rules, whose consistency can then be analyzed with formal methods. Nevertheless, these approaches often present the results from formal verification tools in a way that is inaccessible to non-technical users. This hinders understanding and makes the iterative process of eliciting and validating these requirements inefficient in terms of both time and effort. To address this problem, we introduce SLEEC-LLM, a tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to provide natural-language interpretations for model-checking counterexamples corresponding to SLEEC rule inconsistencies. SLEEC-LLM improves the efficiency and explainability of normative requirements elicitation and consistency analysis. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we summarise its use in two real-world case studies involving non-technical stakeholders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omega-regular Verification and Control for Distributional Specifications in MDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04286v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A classical approach to studying Markov decision processes (MDPs) is to view them as state transformers. However, MDPs can also be viewed as distribution transformers, where an MDP under a strategy generates a sequence of probability distributions over MDP states. This view arises in several applications, even as the probabilistic model checking problem becomes much harder compared to the classical state transformer counterpart. It is known that even distributional reachability and safety problems become computationally intractable (Skolem- and positivity-hard). To address this challenge, recent works focused on sound but possibly incomplete methods for verification and control of MDPs under the distributional view. However, existing automated methods are applicable only to distributional reachability, safety and reach-avoidance specifications. In this work, we present the first automated method for verification and control of MDPs with respect to distributional omega-regular specifications. To achieve this, we propose a novel notion of distributional certificates, which are sound and complete proof rules for proving that an MDP under a distributionally memoryless strategy satisfies some distributional omega-regular specification. We then use our distributional certificates to design the first fully automated algorithms for verification and control of MDPs with respect to distributional omega-regular specifications. Our algorithms follow a template-based synthesis approach and provide soundness and relative completeness guarantees, while running in PSPACE. Our prototype implementation demonstrates practical applicability of our algorithms to challenging examples collected from the literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CONCUR 2025</p></details> |

On the other hand, we show that ATL* module-checking of PMS turns out to be 4EXPTIME-complete, hence exponentially harder than both CTL* pushdown module-checking and ATL* model-checking of PMS. Our result for ATL* provides a rare example of a natural decision problem that is elementary yet but with a complexity that is higher than triply exponential-time.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1709.02107</p></details> |

A language of trees is called sparse if the relative number of $n$-node trees in the language tends to zero, and a language of infinite words is called sparse if it has measure zero in the Bernoulli probability space. We show that sparseness is decidable for regular tree languages and for regular languages of infinite words. For trees, we provide characterisations in terms of forbidden subtrees and tree automata, leading to a linear time decision procedure. For infinite words, we present a characterisation via infix completeness and give a novel proof of decidability. Moreover, in the non-sparse case, our algorithm computes a measurable subset of accepted words that can serve as counterexamples in almost-sure model checking. Our findings have applications to automata based model checking in formal verifications and XML schemas, among others.</p></details> |  |
| **[MITL Model Checking via Generalized Timed Automata and a New Liveness Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08452v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The translation of Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) to timed automata is a topic that has been extensively studied. A key challenge here is the conversion of future modalities into equivalent automata. Typical conversions equip the automata with a guess-and-check mechanism to ascertain the truth of future modalities. Guess-and-check can be naturally implemented via alternation. However, since timed automata tools do not handle alternation, existing methods perform an additional step of converting the alternating timed automata into timed automata. This de-alternation step proceeds by an intricate finite abstraction of the space of configurations of the alternating automaton. Recently, a model of generalized timed automata (GTA) has been proposed. The model comes with several powerful additional features, and yet, the best known zone-based reachability algorithms for timed automata have been extended to the GTA model, with the same complexity for all the zone operations. We provide a new concise translation from MITL to GTA. In particular, for the timed until modality, our translation offers an exponential improvement w.r.t. the state-of-the-art. Thanks to this conversion, MITL model checking reduces to checking liveness for GTAs. However, no liveness algorithm is known for GTAs. Due to the presence of future clocks, there is no finite time-abstract bisimulation (region equivalence) for GTAs, whereas liveness algorithms for timed automata crucially rely on the presence of the finite region equivalence. As our second contribution, we provide a new zone-based algorithm for checking Buchi non-emptiness in GTAs, which circumvents this fundamental challenge.</p></details> |  |

The lock complex consists of two independent locks and a moveable flood-protection barrier. Ensuring safe control of the lock complex is of utmost importance to guarantee both flood-protection and reliable ship operations. This paper gives a precise, formal description of the software control of the lock complex in less than 400 lines of mCRL2 code. This description can act as a blueprint on how the software of this lock complex needs to be constructed. Moreover, using model checking, 53 software requirements are shown to be valid, ensuring that the formal description of the behaviour is correct with regard to these properties and is unlikely to contain mistakes and oversights.</p></details> |  |

We call the corresponding computational problem the hereditary model checking problem for $\phi$, and denote it by Her$(\phi)$. We present a complete description of the quantifier prefixes for $\phi$ such that Her$(\phi)$ is in P; we show that for every other quantifier prefix there exists a formula $\phi$ with this prefix such that Her$(\phi)$ is coNP-complete. Specifically, we show that if $Q$ is of the form $\forall^\ast\exists\forall^\ast$ or of the form $\forall^\ast\exists^\ast$, then Her$(\phi)$ can be solved in polynomial time whenever the quantifier prefix of $\phi$ is $Q$. Otherwise, $Q$ contains $\exists \exists \forall$ or $\exists \forall \exists$ as a subword, and in this case, there is a first-order formula $\phi$ whose quantifier prefix is $Q$ and Her$(\phi)$ is coNP-complete. Moreover, we show that there is no algorithm that decides for a given first-order formula $\phi$ whether Her$(\phi)$ is in P (unless P$=$NP).</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The second version focuses on hereditary first-order logic, and for a better streamlined presentation, we removed all content on extensional ESO which will be submitted elsewhere.

| **[Practical Exploration of Polyhedral Model Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20176v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work explores the potential of spatial model checking of polyhedral models on a number of selected examples. In computer graphics polyhedral models can be found in the form of triangular surface meshes of tetrahedral volume meshes which are abundant. Spatial model checking is used to analyse spatial properties of interest of such models expressed in a suitable spatial logic. The original contributions of this paper are twofold. First we illustrate how a polyhedral model can be enriched by adding the outcome of one model checking session as an atomic proposition to the original model. This is useful as it provides a way to reduce the length of formulas to check on such models and to obtain more insightful results when these models are used for graphical visualisation. Second we show that this form of enrichment also enables practical model minimisation providing deeper insights in the basic spatial structure of the model in terms of the spatial logic properties it enjoys. This work is performed in the context of the geometric spatial model checker PolyLogicA, the visualizer PolyVisualizer and the polyhedral semantics of the Spatial Logic for Closure Spaces SLCS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Regular Model Checking for Systems with Effectively Regular Reachability Relation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18833v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regular model checking is a well-established technique for the verification of regular transition systems (RTS): transition systems whose initial configurations and transition relation can be effectively encoded as regular languages. In 2008, To and Libkin studied RTSs in which the reachability relation (the reflexive and transitive closure of the transition relation) is also effectively regular, and showed that the recurrent reachability problem (whether a regular set $L$ of configurations is reached infinitely often) is polynomial in the size of RTS and the transducer for the reachability relation. We extend the work of To and Libkin by studying the decidability and complexity of verifying almost-sure reachability and recurrent reachability -- that is, whether $L$ is reachable or recurrently reachable w.p. 1. We then apply our results to the more common case in which only a regular overapproximation of the reachability relation is available. In particular, we extend recent complexity results on verifying safety using regular abstraction frameworks -- a technique recently introduced by Czerner, the authors, and Welzel-Mohr -- to liveness and almost-sure properties.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Parameterized Model-checking of Discrete-Timed Networks and Symmetric-Broadcast Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02466v4)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the complexity of the model-checking problem for parameterized discrete-timed systems with arbitrarily many anonymous and identical processes, with and without a distinguished "controller", and communicating via synchronous rendezvous. Our framework extends the seminal work from German and Sistla on untimed systems by adding discrete-time clocks to processes. For the case without a controller, we show that the systems can be efficiently simulated -- and vice versa -- by systems of untimed processes that communicate via rendezvous and symmetric broadcast, which we call "RB-systems". Symmetric broadcast is a novel communication primitive that allows all processes to synchronize at once; however, it does not distinguish between sending and receiving processes. We show that the parameterized model-checking problem for safety specifications is pspace-complete, and for liveness specifications it is decidable in exptime. The latter result is proved using automata theory, rational linear programming, and geometric reasoning for solving certain reachability questions in a new variant of vector addition systems called "vector rendezvous systems". We believe these proof techniques are of independent interest and will be useful in solving related problems. For the case with a controller, we show that the parameterized model-checking problems for RB-systems and systems with asymmetric broadcast as a primitive are inter-reducible. This allows us to prove that for discrete timed-networks with a controller the parameterized model-checking problem is undecidable for liveness specifications. Our work exploits the intimate connection between parameterized discrete-timed systems and systems of processes communicating via broadcast, providing a rare and surprising decidability result for liveness properties of parameterized timed-systems, as well as extend work from untimed systems to timed systems.</p></details> |  |

To the best of our knowledge, HyperSt$^2$ is the first hyperlogic for stochastic games. HyperSt$^2$ can relate probabilities of several independent executions of strategies in a stochastic game. For example, in HyperSt$^2$ it is natural to formalize optimality, i.e., to express that some strategy is better than all other strategies, or to express the existence of Nash equilibria. We investigate the expressivity of HyperSt$^2$ by comparing it to existing logics for stochastic games, as well as existing hyperlogics. Though the model-checking problem for HyperSt$^2$ is in general undecidable, we show that it becomes decidable for bounded memory and is in EXPTIME and PSPACE-hard over memoryless deterministic strategies, and we identify a fragment for which the model-checking problem is PSPACE-complete.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at QEST+FORMATS 2025</p></details> |

Thus, their formal analysis is highly desirable. However, this comes with two major challenges: First, Simulink models often provide an idealized view of real-life systems and omit uncertainties such as, aging, sensor noise or failures. Second, the semantics of Simulink is only informally defined. In this paper, we present an approach to formally analyze safety and performance of embedded control systems modeled in Simulink in the presence of uncertainty. To achieve this, we 1) model different types of uncertainties as stochastic Simulink subsystems and 2) extend an existing formalization of the Simulink semantics based on stochastic hybrid automata (SHA) by providing transformation rules for the stochastic subsystems. Our approach gives us access to established quantitative analysis techniques, like statistical model checking and reachability analysis. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by analyzing safety and performance in the presence of uncertainty for two smaller case studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Logic For Fresh Labelled Transition Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14538v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a Hennessy-Milner logic with recursion for Fresh Labelled Transition Systems (FLTSs). These are nominal labelled transition systems which keep track of the history, i.e. of data values seen so far, and can capture fresh data generation. In particular, FLTSs generalise the computations of Fresh-Register Automata, which in turn are one of the simplest classes of history-dependent automata operating on infinite input alphabets. Each automaton comes equipped with a finite set of registers where it can store data values and compare them with others from the input. In addition, the automaton can accept an input just if it be fresh: not seen in the computation before. The logic we introduce can express a variety of properties, such as the existence of an infinite path of distinct data values or the existence of a finite path where some taint property is violated. We study the model checking problem and its complexity via reduction to parity games and, using nominal sets techniques, provide an exponential upper bound for it.</p></details> | 39 pages |

This paper presents a Bayesian approach to these models in which the issue of model selection is treated in a special way by proposing generalizations of some of the Bayesian procedures used in univariate survival analysis. This research is motivated by a study on the survival of patients with hearth failure undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy, a procedure which involves the implant of a device to stabilize the heartbeat. Two different causes of causes of death have been considered: cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular, and a set of baseline covariates are examined in order to better understand their relationship with both causes of death. Model selection procedures and model checking analyses have been implemented and assessed. The posterior distribution of some relevant outputs such as transition probabilities have been computed and discussed.</p></details> |  |

System engineers frequently examine LTS designs during model checking or design repair to debug, identify inconsistencies, and validate system behavior. Despite LTS's significance, no prior research has examined human comprehension of these designs. To address this, we draw on traditional software engineering and graph theory, identifying 7 key metrics: cyclomatic complexity, state space size, average branching factor, maximum depth, Albin complexity, modularity, and redundancy. We created a dataset of 148 LTS designs, sampling 48 for 324 paired comparisons, and ranked them using the Bradley-Terry model. Through Kendall's Tau correlation analysis, we found that Albin complexity ($\tau = 0.444$), state space size ($\tau = 0.420$), cyclomatic complexity ($\tau = 0.366$), and redundancy ($\tau = 0.315$) most accurately reflect human comprehension of LTS designs. To showcase the metrics' utility, we applied the Albin complexity metric within the Fortis design repair tool, ranking system redesigns. This ranking reduced annotators' comprehension time by 39\%, suggesting that metrics emphasizing human factors can enhance formal design interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need to improve data annotation process in methodology section</p></details> |

In recent years, the main approach to vulnerability detection, fuzzing, has been integrated into the continuous integration process to run in short and frequent cycles. This continuous fuzzing allows for fast identification and remediation of vulnerabilities during the development process. Despite adoption by thousands of projects, however, it is unclear how continuous fuzzing contributes to vulnerability detection. This study aims to elucidate the role of continuous fuzzing in vulnerability detection. Specifically, we investigate the coverage and the total number of fuzzing sessions when fuzzing bugs are discovered. We collect issue reports, coverage reports, and fuzzing logs from OSS-Fuzz, an online service provided by Google that performs fuzzing during continuous integration. Through an empirical study of a total of approximately 1.12 million fuzzing sessions from 878 projects participating in OSS-Fuzz, we reveal that (i) a substantial number of fuzzing bugs exist prior to the integration of continuous fuzzing, leading to a high detection rate in the early stages; (ii) code coverage continues to increase as continuous fuzzing progresses; and (iii) changes in coverage contribute to the detection of fuzzing bugs. This study provides empirical insights into how continuous fuzzing contributes to fuzzing bug detection, offering practical implications for future strategies and tool development in continuous fuzzing.</p></details> |  |

However, the architecture of these controllers introduces new potential attack surfaces that have thus far received inadequate attention. In response to these concerns, we introduce Ambusher, a testing tool designed to discover vulnerabilities within protocols used in distributed SDN controllers. Ambusher achieves this by leveraging protocol state fuzzing, which systematically finds attack scenarios based on an inferred state machine. Since learning states from a cluster is complicated, Ambusher proposes a novel methodology that extracts a single and relatively simple state machine, achieving efficient state-based fuzzing. Our evaluation of Ambusher, conducted on a real SD-WAN deployment spanning two campus networks and one enterprise network, illustrates its ability to uncover 6 potential vulnerabilities in the widely used distributed controller platform.</p></details> | 17 pages, 16 figures |

However, bugs within DL frameworks can cascade into critical issues in higher-level applications, jeopardizing reliability and security. While numerous techniques have been proposed to detect bugs in DL frameworks, research exploring common API patterns across frameworks and the potential risks they entail remains limited. Notably, many DL frameworks expose similar APIs with overlapping input parameters and functionalities, rendering them vulnerable to shared bugs, where a flaw in one API may extend to analogous APIs in other frameworks. To address this challenge, we propose MirrorFuzz, an automated API fuzzing solution to discover shared bugs in DL frameworks. MirrorFuzz operates in three stages: First, MirrorFuzz collects historical bug data for each API within a DL framework to identify potentially buggy APIs. Second, it matches each buggy API in a specific framework with similar APIs within and across other DL frameworks. Third, it employs large language models (LLMs) to synthesize code for the API under test, leveraging the historical bug data of similar APIs to trigger analogous bugs across APIs. We implement MirrorFuzz and evaluate it on four popular DL frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, OneFlow, and Jittor). Extensive evaluation demonstrates that MirrorFuzz improves code coverage by 39.92\% and 98.20\% compared to state-of-the-art methods on TensorFlow and PyTorch, respectively. Moreover, MirrorFuzz discovers 315 bugs, 262 of which are newly found, and 80 bugs are fixed, with 52 of these bugs assigned CNVD IDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Code Review through Fuzzing and Likely Invariants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15512v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many software projects employ manual code review to gatekeep defects and vulnerabilities in the code before integration. However, reviewers often work under time pressure and rely primarily on static inspection, leaving the dynamic aspects of the program unexplored. Dynamic analyses could reveal such behaviors, but they are rarely integrated into reviews. Among them, fuzzing is typically applied later to uncover crashing bugs. Yet its ability to exercise code with diverse inputs makes it promising for exposing non-crashing, but unexpected, behaviors earlier. Still, without suitable mechanisms to analyze program behaviors, the rich data produced during fuzzing remains inaccessible to reviewers, limiting its practical value in this context. We hypothesize that unexpected variations in program behaviors could signify potential bugs. The impact of code changes can be automatically captured at runtime. Representing program behavior as likely invariants, dynamic properties consistently observed at specific program points, can provide practical signals of behavioral changes. Such signals offer a way to distinguish between intended changes and unexpected behavioral shifts from code changes. We present FuzzSight, a framework that leverages likely invariants from non-crashing fuzzing inputs to highlight behavioral differences across program versions. By surfacing such differences, it provides insights into which code blocks may need closer attention. In our evaluation, FuzzSight flagged 75% of regression bugs and up to 80% of vulnerabilities uncovered by 24-hour fuzzing. It also outperformed SAST in identifying buggy code blocks, achieving ten times higher detection rates with fewer false alarms. In summary, FuzzSight demonstrates the potential and value of leveraging fuzzing and invariant analysis for early-stage code review, bridging static inspection with dynamic behavioral insights.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a novel fuzzing framework that runs entirely in the browser and is guided by an LLM to automatically discover such prompt injection vulnerabilities in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages , 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Clutch Control: An Attention-based Combinatorial Bandit for Efficient Mutation in JavaScript Engine Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12732v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>JavaScript engines are widely used in web browsers, PDF readers, and server-side applications. The rise in concern over their security has led to the development of several targeted fuzzing techniques. However, existing approaches use random selection to determine where to perform mutations in JavaScript code. We postulate that the problem of selecting better mutation targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with a volatile number of arms. Thus, we propose CLUTCH, a novel deep combinatorial bandit that can observe variable length JavaScript test case representations, using an attention mechanism from deep learning. Furthermore, using Concrete Dropout, CLUTCH can dynamically adapt its exploration. We show that CLUTCH increases efficiency in JavaScript fuzzing compared to three state-of-the-art solutions by increasing the number of valid test cases and coverage-per-testcase by, respectively, 20.3% and 8.9% on average. In volatile and combinatorial settings we show that CLUTCH outperforms state-of-the-art bandits, achieving at least 78.1% and 4.1% less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs are All You Need? Improving Fuzz Testing for MOJO with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10179v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized software testing, particularly fuzz testing, by automating the generation of diverse and effective test inputs. This advancement holds great promise for improving software reliability. Meanwhile, the introduction of MOJO, a high-performance AI programming language blending Python's usability with the efficiency of C and C++, presents new opportunities to enhance AI model scalability and programmability. However, as a new language, MOJO lacks comprehensive testing frameworks and a sufficient corpus for LLM-based testing, which exacerbates model hallucination. In this case, LLMs will generate syntactically valid but semantically incorrect code, significantly reducing the effectiveness of fuzz testing. To address this challenge, we propose MOJOFuzzer, the first adaptive LLM-based fuzzing framework designed for zero-shot learning environments of emerging programming languages. MOJOFuzzer integrates a mutil-phase framework that systematically eliminates low-quality generated inputs before execution, significantly improving test case validity. Furthermore, MOJOFuzzer dynamically adapts LLM prompts based on runtime feedback for test case mutation, enabling an iterative learning process that continuously enhances fuzzing efficiency and bug detection performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that MOJOFuzzer significantly enhances test validity, API coverage, and bug detection performance, outperforming traditional fuzz testing and state-of-the-art LLM-based fuzzing approaches. Using MOJOFuzzer, we have conducted a first large-scale fuzz testing evaluation of MOJO, uncorvering 13 previous unknown bugs. This study not only advances the field of LLM-driven software testing but also establishes a foundational methodology for leveraging LLMs in the testing of emerging programming languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Psyzkaller: Learning from Historical and On-the-Fly Execution Data for Smarter Seed Generation in OS kernel Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08918v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzing has become a cornerstone technique for uncovering vulnerabilities and enhancing the security of OS kernels. However, state-of-the-art kernel fuzzers, including the de facto standard Syzkaller, struggle to generate valid syscall sequences that respect implicit Syscall Dependency Relations (SDRs). Consequently, many generated seeds either fail kernel validation or cannot penetrate deep execution paths, resulting in significant inefficiency. We hypothesize that SDRs can be effectively learned from both historic and present kernel execution data, and that incorporating these learned relations into fuzzing can substantially improve seed validity and diversity. To validate this, we propose an approach that utilizes the N-gram model to mine SDRs from the Dongting dataset-one of the largest Linux kernel execution datasets available-as well as from execution traces collected on the fly during fuzzing. The resulting model is used to continuously augment the Choice Table of Syzkaller to improve its seed generation and demonstrably increases the Shannon Entropy of the Choice Table throughout fuzzing, reflecting more empirically-grounded choices in expanding syscall sequences into valid and diverse seeds. In addition, we introduce a Random Walk strategy that instructs Syzkaller to construct seeds in a bidirectional manner to further diversify the generated seeds. We implement our approach in a prototype, Psyzkaller, built on top of Syzkaller. Experiments on three representative Linux kernel versions show that Psyzkaller improves Syzkaller's code coverage by 4.6%-7.0% in 48-hour fuzzing, while triggering 110.4%-187.2% more crashes. Moreover, our investigation shows that Psyzkaller discovered eight previously unknown kernel vulnerabilities, compared to only one found by Syzkaller.</p></details> |  |
| **[zkFuzz: Foundation and Framework for Effective Fuzzing of Zero-Knowledge Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11961v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-knowledge (ZK) circuits enable privacy-preserving computations and are central to many cryptographic protocols. Systems like Circom simplify ZK development by combining witness computation and circuit constraints in one program. However, even small errors can compromise security of ZK programs -- under-constrained circuits may accept invalid witnesses, while over-constrained ones may reject valid ones. Static analyzers are often imprecise with high false positives, and formal tools struggle with real-world circuit scale. Additionally, existing tools overlook several critical behaviors, such as intermediate computations and program aborts, and thus miss many vulnerabilities. Our theoretical contribution is the Trace-Constraint Consistency Test (TCCT), a foundational, language-independent formulation of ZK circuit bugs. TCCT provides a unified semantics that subsumes prior definitions and captures both under- and over-constrained vulnerabilities, exposing the full space of ZK bugs that elude prior tools. Our systems contribution is zkFuzz, a novel program mutation-based fuzzing framework for detecting TCCT violations. zkFuzz systematically mutates the computational logic of Zk programs guided by a novel fitness function, and injects carefully crafted inputs using tailored heuristics to expose bugs. We evaluated zkFuzz on 452 real-world ZK circuits written in Circom, a leading programming system for ZK development. zkFuzz successfully identified 85 bugs, including 59 zero-days-39 of which were confirmed by developers and \nfixed fixed, including bugs undetectable by prior works due to their fundamentally limited formulations, earning thousands of bug bounties. Our preliminary research on Noir, another emerging DSL for ZK circuit, also demonstrates the feasibility of zkFuzz to support multiple DSLs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bug Histories as Sources of Compiler Fuzzing Mutators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07834v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bugs in compilers, which are critical infrastructure today, can have outsized negative impacts. Mutational fuzzers aid compiler bug detection by systematically mutating compiler inputs, i.e., programs. Their effectiveness depends on the quality of the mutators used. Yet, no prior work used compiler bug histories as a source of mutators. We propose IssueMut, the first approach for extracting compiler fuzzing mutators from bug histories. Our insight is that bug reports contain hints about program elements that induced compiler bugs; they can guide fuzzers towards similar bugs. IssueMut uses an automated method to mine mutators from bug reports and retrofit such mutators into existing mutational compiler fuzzers. Using IssueMut, we mine 587 mutators from 1760 GCC and LLVM bug reports. Then, we run IssueMut on these compilers, with all their test inputs as seed corpora. We find that "bug history" mutators are effective: they find new bugs that a state-of-the-art mutational compiler fuzzer misses-28 in GCC and 37 in LLVM. Of these, 60 were confirmed or fixed, validating our idea that bug histories have rich information that compiler fuzzers should leverage.</p></details> |  |

However, ensuring the correctness and robustness of MLIR itself remains challenging. Existing fuzzing approaches-based on manually crafted templates or rule-based mutations-struggle to generate sufficiently diverse and semantically valid test cases, making it difficult to expose subtle or deep-seated bugs within MLIR's complex and evolving code space. In this paper, we present FLEX, a novel self-adaptive fuzzing framework for MLIR. FLEX leverages neural networks for program generation, a perturbed sampling strategy to encourage diversity, and a feedback-driven augmentation loop that iteratively improves its model using both crashing and non-crashing test cases. Starting from a limited seed corpus, FLEX progressively learns valid syntax and semantics and autonomously produces high-quality test inputs. We evaluate FLEX on the upstream MLIR compiler against four state-of-the-art fuzzers. In a 30-day campaign, FLEX discovers 80 previously unknown bugs-including multiple new root causes and parser bugs-while in 24-hour fixed-revision comparisons, it detects 53 bugs (over 3.5x as many as the best baseline) and achieves 28.2% code coverage, outperforming the next-best tool by 42%. Ablation studies further confirm the critical role of both perturbed generation and diversity augmentation in FLEX's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Unlike most existing approaches that treat individual seeds as tasks, DynamiQ leverages structural information from the program's call graph to define tasks and continuously refines task allocation using runtime feedback. This design significantly reduces redundant exploration and enhances fuzzing efficiency at scale. Built on top of the state-of-the-art LibAFL framework, DynamiQ incorporates several practical optimizations in both task allocation and task-aware fuzzing. Evaluated on 12 real-world targets from OSS-Fuzz and FuzzBench over 25,000 CPU hours, DynamiQ outperforms state-of-the-art parallel fuzzers in both code coverage and vulnerability discovery, uncovering 9 previously unknown bugs in widely used and extensively fuzzed open-source software.</p></details> |  |
| **[InsightQL: Advancing Human-Assisted Fuzzing with a Unified Code Database and Parameterized Query Interface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04835v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzing is a highly effective automated testing method for uncovering software vulnerabilities. Despite advances in fuzzing techniques, such as coverage-guided greybox fuzzing, many fuzzers struggle with coverage plateaus caused by fuzz blockers, limiting their ability to find deeper vulnerabilities. Human expertise can address these challenges, but analyzing fuzzing results to guide this support remains labor-intensive. To tackle this, we introduce InsightQL, the first human-assisting framework for fuzz blocker analysis. Powered by a unified database and an intuitive parameterized query interface, InsightQL aids developers in systematically extracting insights and efficiently unblocking fuzz blockers. Our experiments on 14 popular real-world libraries from the FuzzBench benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of InsightQL, leading to the unblocking of many fuzz blockers and considerable improvements in code coverage (up to 13.90%).</p></details> |  |
| **[HFuzzer: Testing Large Language Models for Package Hallucinations via Phrase-based Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23835v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for code generation, but they face critical security risks when applied to practical production due to package hallucinations, in which LLMs recommend non-existent packages. These hallucinations can be exploited in software supply chain attacks, where malicious attackers exploit them to register harmful packages. It is critical to test LLMs for package hallucinations to mitigate package hallucinations and defend against potential attacks. Although researchers have proposed testing frameworks for fact-conflicting hallucinations in natural language generation, there is a lack of research on package hallucinations. To fill this gap, we propose HFUZZER, a novel phrase-based fuzzing framework to test LLMs for package hallucinations. HFUZZER adopts fuzzing technology and guides the model to infer a wider range of reasonable information based on phrases, thereby generating enough and diverse coding tasks. Furthermore, HFUZZER extracts phrases from package information or coding tasks to ensure the relevance of phrases and code, thereby improving the relevance of generated tasks and code. We evaluate HFUZZER on multiple LLMs and find that it triggers package hallucinations across all selected models. Compared to the mutational fuzzing framework, HFUZZER identifies 2.60x more unique hallucinated packages and generates more diverse tasks. Additionally, when testing the model GPT-4o, HFUZZER finds 46 unique hallucinated packages. Further analysis reveals that for GPT-4o, LLMs exhibit package hallucinations not only during code generation but also when assisting with environment configuration.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE25 |

However, randomized mutation strategies have limited the fuzzer's performance on structured data. Specialized fuzzers can handle complex structured data, but require additional efforts in grammar and suffer from low throughput. In this paper, we explore the potential of utilizing the Large Language Model to enhance greybox fuzzing for structured data. We utilize the pre-trained knowledge of LLM about data conversion and format to generate new valid inputs. We further fine-tuned it with paired mutation seeds to learn structured format and mutation strategies effectively. Our LLM-based fuzzer, LLAMAFUZZ, integrates the power of LLM to understand and mutate structured data to fuzzing. We conduct experiments on the standard bug-based benchmark Magma and a wide variety of real-world programs. LLAMAFUZZ outperforms our top competitor by 41 bugs on average. We also identified 47 unique bugs across all trials. Moreover, LLAMAFUZZ demonstrated consistent performance on both bug trigger and bug reached. Compared to AFL++, LLAMAFUZZ achieved 27.19% more branches in real-world program sets on average. We also demonstrate a case study to explain how LLMs enhance the fuzzing process in terms of code coverage.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, given the complexity of swarm algorithms, logical vulnerabilities are inevitable and often lead to severe safety and security consequences. Although various methods have been presented for detecting logical vulnerabilities through software testing, when they are used in swarm environments, these techniques face significant challenges: 1) Due to the swarm's vast composable parameter space, it is extremely difficult to generate failure-triggering scenarios, which is crucial to effectively expose logical vulnerabilities; 2) Because of the swarm's high flexibility and dynamism, it is challenging to model and evaluate the global swarm state, particularly in terms of cooperative behaviors, which makes it difficult to detect logical vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose RSFuzz, a robustness-guided swarm fuzzing framework designed to detect logical vulnerabilities in multi-robot systems. It leverages the robustness of behavioral constraints to quantitatively evaluate the swarm state and guide the generation of failure-triggering scenarios. In addition, RSFuzz identifies and targets key swarm nodes for perturbations, effectively reducing the input space. Upon the RSFuzz framework, we construct two swarm fuzzing schemes, Single Attacker Fuzzing (SA-Fuzzing) and Multiple Attacker Fuzzing (MA-Fuzzing), which employ single and multiple attackers, respectively, during fuzzing to disturb swarm mission execution. We evaluated RSFuzz's performance with three popular swarm algorithms in simulated environments. The results show that RSFuzz outperforms the state-of-the-art with an average improvement of 17.75\% in effectiveness and a 38.4\% increase in efficiency. We validated some vulnerabilities in real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 40th IEEE/ACM Automated Software Engineering Conference (ASE 2025)</p></details> |

This paper presents MALF (Multi-Agent LLM Fuzzing Framework), an advanced fuzzing solution that integrates large language models (LLMs) with multi-agent coordination to identify vulnerabilities in industrial control protocols (ICPs). By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific knowledge and QLoRA fine-tuning for protocol-aware input generation, MALF enhances fuzz testing precision and adaptability. The multi-agent framework optimizes seed generation, mutation strategies, and feedback-driven refinement, leading to improved vulnerability discovery. Experiments on protocols like Modbus/TCP, S7Comm, and Ethernet/IP demonstrate that MALF surpasses traditional methods, achieving a test case pass rate (TCPR) of 88-92% and generating more exception triggers (ETN). MALF also maintains over 90% seed coverage and Shannon entropy values between 4.2 and 4.6 bits, ensuring diverse, protocol-compliant mutations. Deployed in a real-world Industrial Attack-Defense Range for power plants, MALF identified critical vulnerabilities, including three zero-day flaws, one confirmed and registered by CNVD. These results validate MALF's effectiveness in real-world fuzzing applications. This research highlights the transformative potential of multi-agent LLMs in ICS cybersecurity, offering a scalable, automated framework that sets a new standard for vulnerability discovery and strengthens critical infrastructure security against emerging threats.</p></details> |  |

Directly fuzzing a function requires fuzz drivers, which translate random fuzzer inputs into valid arguments for the target function. Given the cost and expertise required to manually develop fuzz drivers, methods exist that leverage program analysis and Large Language Models to automatically generate these drivers. However, the generated fuzz drivers frequently lead to false positive crashes, especially in functions highly structured input and complex state requirements. This problem is especially crucial in industry-scale fuzz driver generation efforts like OSS-Fuzz-en, as reporting false positive crashes to maintainers impede trust in both the system and the team. This paper presents two AI-driven strategies to reduce false positives in OSS-Fuzz-Gen, a multi-agent system for automated fuzz driver generation. First, constraint-based fuzz driver generation proactively enforces constraints on a function's inputs and state to guide driver creation. Second, context-based crash validation reactively analyzes function callers to determine whether reported crashes are feasible from program entry points. Using 1,500 benchmark functions from OSS-Fuzz, we show that these strategies reduce spurious crashes by up to 8%, cut reported crashes by more than half, and demonstrate that frontier LLMs can serve as reliable program analysis agents. Our results highlight the promise and challenges of integrating AI into large-scale fuzzing pipelines.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |

E-FuzzEdge addresses the inefficiencies of hardware-in-the-loop fuzzing for microcontrollers by optimizing execution speed. We evaluated our system against state-of-the-art benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance improvements. A key advantage of E-FuzzEdgearchitecture is its compatibility with other embedded fuzzing techniques that perform on device testing instead of firmware emulation. This means that the broader embedded fuzzing community can integrate E-FuzzEdge into their workflows to enhance overall testing efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logic Solver Guided Directed Fuzzing for Hardware Designs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26509v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ever-increasing complexity of design specifications for processors and intellectual property (IP) presents a formidable challenge for early bug detection in the modern IC design cycle. The recent advancements in hardware fuzzing have proven effective in detecting bugs in RTL designs of cutting-edge processors. The modern IC design flow involves incremental updates and modifications to the hardware designs necessitating rigorous verification and extending the overall verification period. To accelerate this process, directed fuzzing has emerged focusing on generating targeted stimuli for specific regions of the design, avoiding the need for exhaustive, full-scale verification. However, a significant limitation of these hardware fuzzers lies in their reliance on an equivalent SW model of the hardware which fails to capture intrinsic hardware characteristics. To circumvent the aforementioned challenges, this work introduces TargetFuzz, an innovative and scalable targeted hardware fuzzing mechanism. It leverages SAT-based techniques to focus on specific regions of the hardware design while operating at its native hardware abstraction level, ensuring a more precise and comprehensive verification process. We evaluated this approach across a diverse range of RTL designs for various IP cores. Our experimental results demonstrate its capability to effectively target and fuzz a broad spectrum of sites within these designs, showcasing its extensive coverage and precision in addressing targeted regions. TargetFuzz demonstrates its capability to effectively scale 30x greater in terms of handling target sites, achieving 100% state coverage and 1.5x faster in terms of site coverage, and shows 90x improvement in target state coverage compared to Coverage-Guided Fuzzing, demonstrating its potential to advance the state-of-the-art in directed hardware fuzzing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intelligent Graybox Fuzzing via ATPG-Guided Seed Generation and Submodule Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20808v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware Fuzzing emerged as one of the crucial techniques for finding security flaws in modern hardware designs by testing a wide range of input scenarios. One of the main challenges is creating high-quality input seeds that maximize coverage and speed up verification. Coverage-Guided Fuzzing (CGF) methods help explore designs more effectively, but they struggle to focus on specific parts of the hardware. Existing Directed Gray-box Fuzzing (DGF) techniques like DirectFuzz try to solve this by generating targeted tests, but it has major drawbacks, such as supporting only limited hardware description languages, not scaling well to large circuits, and having issues with abstraction mismatches. To address these problems, we introduce a novel framework, PROFUZZ, that follows the DGF approach and combines fuzzing with Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) for more efficient fuzzing. By leveraging ATPG's structural analysis capabilities, PROFUZZ can generate precise input seeds that target specific design regions more effectively while maintaining high fuzzing throughput. Our experiments show that PROFUZZ scales 30x better than DirectFuzz when handling multiple target sites, improves coverage by 11.66%, and runs 2.76x faster, highlighting its scalability and effectiveness for directed fuzzing in complex hardware systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Semantic-Aware Fuzzing: An Empirical Framework for LLM-Guided, Reasoning-Driven Input Mutation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19533v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Security vulnerabilities in Internet-of-Things devices, mobile platforms, and autonomous systems remain critical. Traditional mutation-based fuzzers -- while effectively explore code paths -- primarily perform byte- or bit-level edits without semantic reasoning. Coverage-guided tools such as AFL++ use dictionaries, grammars, and splicing heuristics to impose shallow structural constraints, leaving deeper protocol logic, inter-field dependencies, and domain-specific semantics unaddressed. Conversely, reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) can leverage pretraining knowledge to understand input formats, respect complex constraints, and propose targeted mutations, much like an experienced reverse engineer or testing expert. However, lacking ground truth for "correct" mutation reasoning makes supervised fine-tuning impractical, motivating explorations of off-the-shelf LLMs via prompt-based few-shot learning. To bridge this gap, we present an open-source microservices framework that integrates reasoning LLMs with AFL++ on Google's FuzzBench, tackling asynchronous execution and divergent hardware demands (GPU- vs. CPU-intensive) of LLMs and fuzzers. We evaluate four research questions: (R1) How can reasoning LLMs be integrated into the fuzzing mutation loop? (R2) Do few-shot prompts yield higher-quality mutations than zero-shot? (R3) Can prompt engineering with off-the-shelf models improve fuzzing directly? and (R4) Which open-source reasoning LLMs perform best under prompt-only conditions? Experiments with Llama3.3, Deepseek-r1-Distill-Llama-70B, QwQ-32B, and Gemma3 highlight Deepseek as the most promising. Mutation effectiveness depends more on prompt complexity and model choice than shot count. Response latency and throughput bottlenecks remain key obstacles, offering directions for future work.</p></details> |  |

Testing these devices is crucial from a security perspective since vendors often use custom closed- or open-source software without documenting releases and patches. Recent coverage-guided fuzzing solutions primarily test individual processes, ignoring deep dependencies between daemons and their persistent internal state. This article presents STAFF, a firmware fuzzing framework for discovering bugs in Linux-based firmware built around three key ideas: (a) user-driven multi-request recording, which monitors user interactions with emulated firmware to capture request sequences involving application-layer protocols (e.g., HTTP); (b) intra- and inter-process dependency detection, which uses whole-system taint analysis to track how input bytes influence user-space states, including files, sockets, and memory areas; (c) protocol-aware taint-guided fuzzing, which applies mutations to request sequences based on identified dependencies, exploiting multi-staged forkservers to efficiently checkpoint protocol states. When evaluating STAFF on 15 Linux-based firmware targets, it identifies 42 bugs involving multiple network requests and different firmware daemons, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art fuzzing solutions in both the number and reproducibility of discovered bugs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review at Computers & Security (Elsevier)</p></details> |
| **[BASFuzz: Towards Robustness Evaluation of LLM-based NLP Software via Automated Fuzz Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17335v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzing has shown great success in evaluating the robustness of intelligent natural language processing (NLP) software. As large language model (LLM)-based NLP software is widely deployed in critical industries, existing methods still face two main challenges: 1 testing methods are insufficiently coupled with the behavioral patterns of LLM-based NLP software; 2 fuzzing capability for the testing scenario of natural language generation (NLG) generally degrades. To address these issues, we propose BASFuzz, an efficient Fuzz testing method tailored for LLM-based NLP software. BASFuzz targets complete test inputs composed of prompts and examples, and uses a text consistency metric to guide mutations of the fuzzing loop, aligning with the behavioral patterns of LLM-based NLP software. A Beam-Annealing Search algorithm, which integrates beam search and simulated annealing, is employed to design an efficient fuzzing loop. In addition, information entropy-based adaptive adjustment and an elitism strategy further enhance fuzzing capability. We evaluate BASFuzz on six datasets in representative scenarios of NLG and natural language understanding (NLU). Experimental results demonstrate that BASFuzz achieves a testing effectiveness of 90.335% while reducing the average time overhead by 2,163.852 seconds compared to the current best baseline, enabling more effective robustness evaluation prior to software deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[R1-Fuzz: Specializing Language Models for Textual Fuzzing via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20384v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzing is effective for vulnerability discovery but struggles with complex targets such as compilers, interpreters, and database engines, which accept textual input that must satisfy intricate syntactic and semantic constraints. Although language models (LMs) have attracted interest for this task due to their vast latent knowledge and reasoning potential, their practical adoption has been limited. The major challenges stem from insufficient exploration of deep program logic among real-world codebases, and the high cost of leveraging larger models. To overcome these challenges, we propose R1-Fuzz, the first framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to specialize cost-efficient LMs and integrate them for complex textual fuzzing input generation. R1-Fuzz introduces two key designs: coverage-slicing-based question construction and a distance-based reward calculation. Through RL-based post-training of a model with our constructed dataset, R1-Fuzz designs a fuzzing workflow that tightly integrates LMs to reason deep program semantics during fuzzing. Evaluations on diverse real-world targets show that our design enables a small model, named R1-Fuzz-7B, to rival or even outperform much larger models in real-world fuzzing. Notably, R1-Fuzz achieves up to 75\% higher coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzers and discovers 29 previously unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating its practicality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Orion: Fuzzing Workflow Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15195v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzz testing is one of the most effective techniques for finding software vulnerabilities. While modern fuzzers can generate inputs and monitor executions automatically, the overall workflow, from analyzing a codebase, to configuring harnesses, to triaging results, still requires substantial manual effort. Prior attempts focused on single stages such as harness synthesis or input minimization, leaving researchers to manually connect the pieces into a complete fuzzing campaign. We introduce Orion, a framework that automates the the manual bottlenecks of fuzzing by integrating LLM reasoning with traditional tools, allowing campaigns to scale to settings where human effort alone was impractical. Orion uses LLMs for code reasoning and semantic guidance, while relying on deterministic tools for verification, iterative refinement, and tasks that require precision. Across our benchmark suite, Orion reduces human effort by 46-204x depending on the workflow stage, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through the discovery of two previously unknown vulnerabilities in the widely used open-source clib library.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating the Effectiveness of Coverage-Guided Fuzzing for Testing Deep Learning Library APIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14626v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning (DL) libraries such as PyTorch provide the core components to build major AI-enabled applications. Finding bugs in these libraries is important and challenging. Prior approaches have tackled this by performing either API-level fuzzing or model-level fuzzing, but they do not use coverage guidance, which limits their effectiveness and efficiency. This raises an intriguing question: can coverage guided fuzzing (CGF), in particular frameworks like LibFuzzer, be effectively applied to DL libraries, and does it offer meaningful improvements in code coverage, bug detection, and scalability compared to prior methods? We present the first in-depth study to answer this question. A key challenge in applying CGF to DL libraries is the need to create a test harness for each API that can transform byte-level fuzzer inputs into valid API inputs. To address this, we propose FlashFuzz, a technique that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically synthesize API-level harnesses by combining templates, helper functions, and API documentation. FlashFuzz uses a feedback driven strategy to iteratively synthesize and repair harnesses. With this approach, FlashFuzz synthesizes harnesses for 1,151 PyTorch and 662 TensorFlow APIs. Compared to state-of-the-art fuzzing methods (ACETest, PathFinder, and TitanFuzz), FlashFuzz achieves up to 101.13 to 212.88 percent higher coverage and 1.0x to 5.4x higher validity rate, while also delivering 1x to 1182x speedups in input generation. FlashFuzz has discovered 42 previously unknown bugs in PyTorch and TensorFlow, 8 of which are already fixed. Our study confirms that CGF can be effectively applied to DL libraries and provides a strong baseline for future testing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Protocol-Aware Firmware Rehosting for Effective Fuzzing of Embedded Network Stacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13740v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the biggest attack surfaces of embedded systems is their network interfaces, which enable communication with other devices. Unlike their general-purpose counterparts, embedded systems are designed for specialized use cases, resulting in unique and diverse communication stacks. Unfortunately, current approaches for evaluating the security of these embedded network stacks require manual effort or access to hardware, and they generally focus only on small parts of the embedded system. A promising alternative is firmware rehosting, which enables fuzz testing of the entire firmware by generically emulating the physical hardware. However, existing rehosting methods often struggle to meaningfully explore network stacks due to their complex, multi-layered input formats. This limits their ability to uncover deeply nested software faults. To address this problem, we introduce a novel method to automatically detect and handle the use of network protocols in firmware called Pemu. By automatically deducing the available network protocols, Pemu can transparently generate valid network packets that encapsulate fuzzing data, allowing the fuzzing input to flow directly into deeper layers of the firmware logic. Our approach thus enables a deeper, more targeted, and layer-by-layer analysis of firmware components that were previously difficult or impossible to test. Our evaluation demonstrates that Pemu consistently improves the code coverage of three existing rehosting tools for embedded network stacks. Furthermore, our fuzzer rediscovered several known vulnerabilities and identified five previously unknown software faults, highlighting its effectiveness in uncovering deeply nested bugs in network-exposed code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of our paper "Protocol-Aware Fimrware Rehosting for Effective Fuzzing of Embedded Network Stacks" published at ACM CCS 2025</p></details> |

The increasing complexity of processor designs and the emergence of new instruction set architectures (ISAs) like RISC-V have created demands for more agile and efficient verification methodologies, particularly regarding verification efficiency and faster coverage convergence. While simulation-based approaches now attempt to incorporate advanced software testing techniques such as fuzzing to improve coverage, they face significant limitations when applied to processor verification, notably poor performance and inadequate test case quality. Hardware-accelerated solutions using FPGA or ASIC platforms have tried to address these issues, yet they struggle with challenges including host-FPGA communication overhead, inefficient test pattern generation, and suboptimal implementation of the entire multi-step verification process. In this paper, we present TurboFuzz, an end-to-end hardware-accelerated verification framework that implements the entire Test Generation-Simulation-Coverage Feedback loop on a single FPGA for modern processor verification. TurboFuzz enhances test quality through optimized test case (seed) control flow, efficient inter-seed scheduling, and hybrid fuzzer integration, thereby improving coverage and execution efficiency. Additionally, it employs a feedback-driven generation mechanism to accelerate coverage convergence. Experimental results show that TurboFuzz achieves up to 2.23x more coverage collection than software-based fuzzers within the same time budget, and up to 571x performance speedup when detecting real-world issues, while maintaining full visibility and debugging capabilities with moderate area overhead.</p></details> |  |

This approach relies on instrumenting the target code at compile time. However, applying it to industrial systems remains challenging, due to proprietary and closed-source compiler toolchains and lack of access to source code. FuzzBox addresses these limitations by integrating emulation with fuzzing: it dynamically instruments code during execution in a virtualized environment, for the injection of fuzz inputs, failure detection, and coverage analysis, without requiring source code recompilation and hardware-specific dependencies. We show the effectiveness of FuzzBox through experiments in the context of a proprietary MILS (Multiple Independent Levels of Security) hypervisor for industrial applications. Additionally, we analyze the applicability of FuzzBox across commercial IoT firmware, showcasing its broad portability.</p></details> |  |
| **[FuzzRDUCC: Fuzzing with Reconstructed Def-Use Chain Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04967v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary-only fuzzing often struggles with achieving thorough code coverage and uncovering hidden vulnerabilities due to limited insight into a program's internal dataflows. Traditional grey-box fuzzers guide test case generation primarily using control flow edge coverage, which can overlook bugs not easily exposed through control flow analysis alone. We argue that integrating dataflow analysis into the fuzzing process can enhance its effectiveness by revealing how data propagates through the program, thereby enabling the exploration of execution paths that control flow-based methods might miss. In this context, we introduce FuzzRDUCC, a novel fuzzing framework that employs symbolic execution to reconstruct definition-use (def-use) chains directly from binary executables. FuzzRDUCC identifies crucial dataflow paths and exposes security vulnerabilities without incurring excessive computational overhead, due to a novel heuristic algorithm that selects relevant def-use chains without affecting the thoroughness of the fuzzing process. We evaluate FuzzRDUCC using the binutils benchmark and demonstrate that it can identify unique crashes not found by state-of-the-art fuzzers. Hence, establishing FuzzRDUCC as a feasible solution for next generation vulnerability detection and discovery mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locus: Agentic Predicate Synthesis for Directed Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21302v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes, confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search; however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to generalize to diverse target states and programs. We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x. So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already acknowledged with a draft patch.</p></details> |  |

As such, a lot of research work has been carried out on this topic in the last few years. However, there are three major issues that hinder further progress: how to deal with API authentication; how to catalog and compare different fault types found by different fuzzers; and what to use as case study to facilitate fair comparisons among fuzzers. To address these important challenges, we present Web Fuzzing Commons (WFC) and Web Fuzzing Dataset (WFD). WFC is a set of open-source libraries and schema definitions to declaratively specify authentication info and catalog different types of faults that fuzzers can automatically detect. WFD is a collection of 36 open-source APIs with all necessary scaffolding to easily run experiments with fuzzers, supported by WFC. To show the usefulness of WFC/WFD, a set of experiments is carried out with EvoMaster, a state-of-the-art fuzzer for Web APIs. However, any fuzzer can benefit from WFC and WFD. We compare EvoMaster with other state-of-the-art tools such as ARAT-RL, EmRest, LLamaRestTest, RESTler, and Schemathesis. We discuss common pitfalls in tool comparisons, as well as providing guidelines with support of WFC/WFD to avoid them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging SystemC-TLM-based Virtual Prototypes for Embedded Software Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01318v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SystemC-based virtual prototypes have emerged as widely adopted tools to test software ahead of hardware availability, reducing the time-to-market and improving software reliability. Recently, fuzzing has become a popular method for automated software testing due to its ability to quickly identify corner-case errors. However, its application to embedded software is still limited. Simulator tools can help bridge this gap by providing a more powerful and controlled execution environment for testing. Existing solutions, however, often tightly couple fuzzers with built-in simulators that lack support for hardware peripherals and offer limited flexibility, restricting their ability to test embedded software. To address these limitations, we present a framework that allows the integration of American-Fuzzy-Lop-based fuzzers and SystemC-based simulators. The framework provides a harness to decouple the adopted fuzzer and simulator. In addition, it intercepts peripheral accesses and queries the fuzzer for values, effectively linking peripheral behavior to the fuzzer. This solution enables flexible interchangeability of peripherals within the simulation environment and supports the interfacing of different SystemC-based virtual prototypes. The flexibility of the proposed solution is demonstrated by integrating the harness with different simulators and by testing various softwares.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-guided Fuzzing of Distributed Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02307v3)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a coverage-guided testing algorithm for distributed systems implementations. Our main innovation is the use of an abstract formal model of the system that is used to define coverage. Such abstract models are frequently developed in early phases of protocol design and verification but are infrequently used at testing time. We show that guiding random test generation using model coverage can be effective in covering interesting points in the implementation state space. We have implemented a fuzzer for distributed system implementations and abstract models written in TLA+. Our algorithm shows better coverage over purely random exploration as well as random exploration guided by different notions of scheduler coverage and mutation. In particular, we show consistently higher coverage and detect bugs faster on implementations of distributed consensus protocols such as those in Etcd-raft and RedisRaft. Moreover, we discovered 13 previously unknown bugs in their implementations, four of which could only be detected by model-guided fuzzing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Skeleton-Driven SMT Solver Fuzzing by Leveraging LLM to Produce Formula Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20340v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like symbolic execution and automated verification. Because these solvers sit on the critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas are key to uncovering bugs. However, while prior testing techniques performed well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving features. Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain: nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead. In this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. Particularly, Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2) synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars. During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators. This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity. Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment, dramatically reducing runtime cost. We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT solvers: Z3 and cvc5. Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43 confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.</p></details> |  |
| **[May the Feedback Be with You! Unlocking the Power of Feedback-Driven Deep Learning Framework Fuzzing via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17642v3)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning (DL) frameworks have served as fundamental components in DL systems over the last decade. However, bugs in DL frameworks could lead to catastrophic consequences in critical scenarios. A simple yet effective way to find bugs in DL frameworks is fuzz testing (Fuzzing). Existing approaches focus on test generation, leaving execution results with high semantic value (e.g., coverage information, bug reports, and exception logs) in the wild, which can serve as multiple types of feedback. To fill this gap, we propose FUEL to effectively utilize the feedback information, which comprises two Large Language Models (LLMs): analysis LLM and generation LLM. Specifically, analysis LLM infers analysis summaries from feedback information, while the generation LLM creates tests guided by these summaries. Furthermore, based on multiple feedback guidance, we design two additional components: (i) a feedback-aware simulated annealing algorithm to select operators for test generation, enriching test diversity. (ii) a program self-repair strategy to automatically repair invalid tests, enhancing test validity. We evaluate FUEL on the two most popular DL frameworks, and experiment results show that FUEL can improve line code coverage of PyTorch and TensorFlow by 9.15% and 14.70% over state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., TitanFuzz and WhiteFox). By the time of submission, FUEL has detected 104 previously unknown bugs for PyTorch and TensorFlow, with 93 confirmed as new bugs, 49 already fixed, and 14 assigned CVE IDs. Our artifact is available at https://github.com/NJU-iSE/FUEL</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiFuzz: A Dense Retrieval-based Multi-Agent System for Network Protocol Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14300v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional protocol fuzzing techniques, such as those employed by AFL-based systems, often lack effectiveness due to a limited semantic understanding of complex protocol grammars and rigid seed mutation strategies. Recent works, such as ChatAFL, have integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide protocol fuzzing and address these limitations, pushing protocol fuzzers to wider exploration of the protocol state space. But ChatAFL still faces issues like unreliable output, LLM hallucinations, and assumptions of LLM knowledge about protocol specifications. This paper introduces MultiFuzz, a novel dense retrieval-based multi-agent system designed to overcome these limitations by integrating semantic-aware context retrieval, specialized agents, and structured tool-assisted reasoning. MultiFuzz utilizes agentic chunks of protocol documentation (RFC Documents) to build embeddings in a vector database for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling agents to generate more reliable and structured outputs, enhancing the fuzzer in mutating protocol messages with enhanced state coverage and adherence to syntactic constraints. The framework decomposes the fuzzing process into modular groups of agents that collaborate through chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically adapt fuzzing strategies based on the retrieved contextual knowledge. Experimental evaluations on the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) demonstrate that MultiFuzz significantly improves branch coverage and explores deeper protocol states and transitions over state-of-the-art (SOTA) fuzzers such as NSFuzz, AFLNet, and ChatAFL. By combining dense retrieval, agentic coordination, and language model reasoning, MultiFuzz establishes a new paradigm in autonomous protocol fuzzing, offering a scalable and extensible foundation for future research in intelligent agentic-based fuzzing systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[LLM-Assisted Model-Based Fuzzing of Protocol Implementations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01750v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Testing network protocol implementations is critical for ensuring the reliability, security, and interoperability of distributed systems. Faults in protocol behavior can lead to vulnerabilities and system failures, especially in real-time and mission-critical applications. A common approach to protocol testing involves constructing Markovian models that capture the state transitions and expected behaviors of the protocol. However, building such models typically requires significant domain expertise and manual effort, making the process time-consuming and difficult to scale across diverse protocols and implementations. We propose a novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate sequences for testing network protocol implementations. Our approach begins by defining the full set of possible protocol states, from which the LLM selects a subset to model the target implementation. Using this state-based model, we prompt the LLM to generate code that produces sequences of states. This program serves as a protocol-specific sequences generator. The sequences generator then generates test inputs to call the protocol implementation under various conditions. We evaluated our approach on three widely used network protocol implementations and successfully identified 12 previously unknown vulnerabilities. We have reported them to the respective developers for confirmation. This demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our LLM-assisted fuzzing framework in uncovering real-world security issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ensemble Fuzzing with Dynamic Resource Scheduling and Multidimensional Seed Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22442v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzing is widely used for detecting bugs and vulnerabilities, with various techniques proposed to enhance its effectiveness. To combine the advantages of multiple technologies, researchers proposed ensemble fuzzing, which integrates multiple base fuzzers. Despite promising results, state-of-the-art ensemble fuzzing techniques face limitations in resource scheduling and performance evaluation, leading to unnecessary resource waste. In this paper, we propose Legion, a novel ensemble fuzzing framework that dynamically schedules resources during the ensemble fuzzing campaign. We designed a novel resource scheduling algorithm based on the upper confidence bound algorithm to reduce the resource consumption of ineffective base fuzzers. Additionally, we introduce a multidimensional seed evaluation strategy, which considers multiple metrics to achieve more comprehensive fine-grained performance evaluation. We implemented Legion as a prototype tool and evaluated its effectiveness on Google's fuzzer-test-suite as well as real-world open-source projects. Results show that Legion outperforms existing state-of-the-art base fuzzers and ensemble fuzzing techniques, detecting 20 vulnerabilities in real-world open-source projects-five previously unknown and three classified as CVEs.</p></details> | first submit |
| **[DeepGo: Predictive Directed Greybox Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21952v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The state-of-the-art DGF techniques redefine and optimize the fitness metric to reach the target sites precisely and quickly. However, optimizations for fitness metrics are mainly based on heuristic algorithms, which usually rely on historical execution information and lack foresight on paths that have not been exercised yet. Thus, those hard-to-execute paths with complex constraints would hinder DGF from reaching the targets, making DGF less efficient. In this paper, we propose DeepGo, a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that can combine historical and predicted information to steer DGF to reach the target site via an optimal path. We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF as a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition sequences. The new seed generated by mutation would cause the path transition, and the path corresponding to the high-reward path transition sequence indicates a high likelihood of reaching the target site through it. Then, to predict the path transitions and the corresponding rewards, we use deep neural networks to construct a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE), which gradually imitates the path transition model and predicts the rewards of path transitions that have not been taken yet. To determine the optimal path, we develop a Reinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model to generate the transition sequences with the highest sequence rewards. The RLF model can combine historical and predicted path transitions to generate the optimal path transition sequences, along with the policy to guide the mutation strategy of fuzzing. Finally, to exercise the high-reward path transition sequence, we propose the concept of an action group, which comprehensively optimizes the critical steps of fuzzing to realize the optimal path to reach the target efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Search-Based Fuzzing For RESTful APIs That Use MongoDB](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20848v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In RESTful APIs, interactions with a database are a common and crucial aspect. When generating whitebox tests, it is essential to consider the database's state (i.e., the data contained in the database) to achieve higher code coverage and uncover more hidden faults. This article presents novel techniques to enhance search-based software test generation for RESTful APIs interacting with NoSQL databases. Specifically, we target the popular MongoDB database, by dynamically analyzing (via automated code instrumentation) the state of the database during the test generation process. Additionally, to achieve better results, our novel approach allows inserting NoSQL data directly from test cases. This is particularly beneficial when generating the correct sequence of events to set the NoSQL database in an appropriate state is challenging or time-consuming. This method is also advantageous for testing read-only microservices. Our novel techniques are implemented as an extension of EvoMaster, the only open-source tool for white-box fuzzing RESTful APIs. Experiments conducted on six RESTful APIs demonstrated significant improvements in code coverage, with increases of up to 18% compared to existing white-box approaches. To better highlight the improvements of our novel techniques, comparisons are also carried out with four state-of-the-art black-box fuzzers.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods rely heavily on manual design or human-in-the-loop correction, limiting scalability and cross-language generalizability. We present Mut4All, a fully automated, language-agnostic framework that synthesizes mutators using Large Language Models (LLMs) and compiler-specific knowledge from bug reports. It consists of three agents: (1) a mutator invention agent that identifies mutation targets and generates mutator metadata using compiler-related insights; (2) a mutator implementation synthesis agent, fine-tuned to produce initial implementations; and (3) a mutator refinement agent that verifies and corrects the mutators via unit-test feedback. Mut4All processes 1000 bug reports (500 Rust, 500 C++), yielding 319 Rust and 403 C++ mutators at ~$0.08 each via GPT-4o. Our customized fuzzer, using these mutators, finds 62 bugs in Rust compilers (38 new, 7 fixed) and 34 bugs in C++ compilers (16 new, 1 fixed). Mut4All outperforms existing methods in both unique crash detection and coverage, ranking first on Rust and second on C++.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scheduzz: Constraint-based Fuzz Driver Generation with Dual Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18289v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzing a library requires experts to understand the library usage well and craft high-quality fuzz drivers, which is tricky and tedious. Therefore, many techniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers. However, they fail to generate rational fuzz drivers due to the lack of adherence to proper library usage conventions, such as ensuring a resource is closed after being opened. To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques unconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers that waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and generating false positive bug reports. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing technique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique. It leverages LLMs to understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination constraints. To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling framework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz drivers. The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing campaign as an online optimization problem. Within the scheduling loop, multiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while simultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or suspension. We implemented Scheduzz and evaluated it in 33 real-world libraries. Compared to baseline approaches, Scheduzz significantly reduces computational overhead and outperforms UTopia on 16 out of 21 libraries. It achieves 1.62x, 1.50x, and 1.89x higher overall coverage than the state-of-the-art techniques CKGFuzzer, Promptfuzz, and the handcrafted project OSS-Fuzz, respectively. In addition, Scheduzz discovered 33 previously unknown bugs in these well-tested libraries, 3 of which have been assigned CVEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Assessing Reliability of Statistical Maximum Coverage Estimators in Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17093v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Fuzzers are often guided by coverage, making the estimation of maximum achievable coverage a key concern in fuzzing. However, achieving 100% coverage is infeasible for most real-world software systems, regardless of effort. While static reachability analysis can provide an upper bound, it is often highly inaccurate. Recently, statistical estimation methods based on species richness estimators from biostatistics have been proposed as a potential solution. Yet, the lack of reliable benchmarks with labeled ground truth has limited rigorous evaluation of their accuracy. Objective: This work examines the reliability of reachability estimators from two axes: addressing the lack of labeled ground truth and evaluating their reliability on real-world programs. Methods: (1) To address the challenge of labeled ground truth, we propose an evaluation framework that synthetically generates large programs with complex control flows, ensuring well-defined reachability and providing ground truth for evaluation. (2) To address the criticism from use of synthetic benchmarks, we adapt a reliability check for reachability estimators on real-world benchmarks without labeled ground truth -- by varying the size of sampling units, which, in theory, should not affect the estimate. Results: These two studies together will help answer the question of whether current reachability estimators are reliable, and defines a protocol to evaluate future improvements in reachability estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICSME...</summary><p>ICSME'25 Registered Report</p></details> |
| **[BandFuzz: An ML-powered Collaborative Fuzzing Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10845v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative fuzzing combines multiple individual fuzzers and dynamically chooses appropriate combinations for different programs. Unlike individual fuzzers that rely on specific assumptions, collaborative fuzzing relaxes assumptions on target programs, providing robust performance across various programs. However, existing collaborative fuzzing frameworks face challenges including additional computational resource requirements and inefficient resource allocation among fuzzers. To tackle these challenges, we present BANDFUZZ, an ML-powered collaborative fuzzing framework that outperforms individual fuzzers without requiring additional computational resources. The key contribution of BANDFUZZ lies in its novel resource allocation algorithm driven by our proposed multi-armed bandits model. Different from greedy methods in existing frameworks, BANDFUZZ models the long-term impact of individual fuzzers, enabling discovery of globally optimal collaborative strategies. We propose a novel fuzzer evaluation method that assesses not only code coverage but also the fuzzer's capability of solving difficult branches. Finally, we integrate a real-time seed synchronization mechanism and implementation-wise optimizations to improve fuzzing efficiency and stability. Through extensive experiments on Fuzzbench and Fuzzer Test Suite, we show that BANDFUZZ outperforms state-of-the-art collaborative fuzzing framework autofz and widely used individual fuzzers. We verify BANDFUZZ's key designs through comprehensive ablation study. Notably, we demonstrate BANDFUZZ's effectiveness in real-world bug detection by analyzing results of a worldwide fuzzing competition, where BANDFUZZ won first place.</p></details> |  |
| **[LibLMFuzz: LLM-Augmented Fuzz Target Generation for Black-box Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15058v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental problem in cybersecurity and computer science is determining whether a program is free of bugs and vulnerabilities. Fuzzing, a popular approach to discovering vulnerabilities in programs, has several advantages over alternative strategies, although it has investment costs in the form of initial setup and continuous maintenance. The choice of fuzzing is further complicated when only a binary library is available, such as the case of closed-source and proprietary software. In response, we introduce LibLMFuzz, a framework that reduces costs associated with fuzzing closed-source libraries by pairing an agentic Large Language Model (LLM) with a lightweight tool-chain (disassembler/compiler/fuzzer) to autonomously analyze stripped binaries, plan fuzz strategies, generate drivers, and iteratively self-repair build or runtime errors. Tested on four widely-used Linux libraries, LibLMFuzz produced syntactically correct drivers for all 558 fuzz-able API functions, achieving 100% API coverage with no human intervention. Across the 1601 synthesized drivers, 75.52% were nominally correct on first execution. The results show that LLM-augmented middleware holds promise in reducing the costs of fuzzing black box components and provides a foundation for future research efforts. Future opportunities exist for research in branch coverage.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 2 listings</p></details> |
| **[Harnessing LLMs for Document-Guided Fuzzing of OpenCV Library](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14558v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The combination of computer vision and artificial intelligence is fundamentally transforming a broad spectrum of industries by enabling machines to interpret and act upon visual data with high levels of accuracy. As the biggest and by far the most popular open-source computer vision library, OpenCV library provides an extensive suite of programming functions supporting real-time computer vision. Bugs in the OpenCV library can affect the downstream computer vision applications, and it is critical to ensure the reliability of the OpenCV library. This paper introduces VISTAFUZZ, a novel technique for harnessing large language models (LLMs) for document-guided fuzzing of the OpenCV library. VISTAFUZZ utilizes LLMs to parse API documentation and obtain standardized API information. Based on this standardized information, VISTAFUZZ extracts constraints on individual input parameters and dependencies between these. Using these constraints and dependencies, VISTAFUZZ then generates new input values to systematically test each target API. We evaluate the effectiveness of VISTAFUZZ in testing 330 APIs in the OpenCV library, and the results show that VISTAFUZZ detected 17 new bugs, where 10 bugs have been confirmed, and 5 of these have been fixed.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLAMA: Multi-Feedback Smart Contract Fuzzing Framework with LLM-Guided Seed Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12084v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts play a pivotal role in blockchain ecosystems, and fuzzing remains an important approach to securing smart contracts. Even though mutation scheduling is a key factor influencing fuzzing effectiveness, existing fuzzers have primarily explored seed scheduling and generation, while mutation scheduling has been rarely addressed by prior work. In this work, we propose a Large Language Models (LLMs)-based Multi-feedback Smart Contract Fuzzing framework (LLAMA) that integrates LLMs, evolutionary mutation strategies, and hybrid testing techniques. Key components of the proposed LLAMA include: (i) a hierarchical prompting strategy that guides LLMs to generate semantically valid initial seeds, coupled with a lightweight pre-fuzzing phase to select high-potential inputs; (ii) a multi-feedback optimization mechanism that simultaneously improves seed generation, seed selection, and mutation scheduling by leveraging runtime coverage and dependency feedback; and (iii) an evolutionary fuzzing engine that dynamically adjusts mutation operator probabilities based on effectiveness, while incorporating symbolic execution to escape stagnation and uncover deeper vulnerabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that LLAMA outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in both coverage and vulnerability detection. Specifically, it achieves 91% instruction coverage and 90% branch coverage, while detecting 132 out of 148 known vulnerabilities across diverse categories. These results highlight LLAMA's effectiveness, adaptability, and practicality in real-world smart contract security testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[PathFuzzing: Worst Case Analysis by Fuzzing Symbolic-Execution Paths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09892v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating worst-case resource consumption is a critical task in software development. The worst-case analysis (WCA) problem is an optimization-based abstraction of this task. Fuzzing and symbolic execution are widely used techniques for addressing the WCA problem. However, improving code coverage in fuzzing or managing path explosion in symbolic execution within the context of WCA poses significant challenges. In this paper, we propose PathFuzzing, aiming to combine the strengths of both techniques to design a WCA method. The key idea is to transform a program into a symbolic one that takes an execution path (encoded as a binary string) and interprets the bits as branch decisions. PathFuzzing then applies evolutionary fuzzing techniques to the transformed program to search for binary strings that represent satisfiable path conditions and lead to high resource consumption. We evaluate the performance of PathFuzzing experimentally on a benchmark suite that consists of prior work's benchmarks and some added by us. Results show that PathFuzzing generally outperforms a fuzzing and a symbolic-execution baseline.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |

Due to their complexity, manual testing is unlikely to suffice, yet formal verification is difficult to scale. End-to-end fuzzing can be used, but it has difficulties in achieving high coverage of some components of LLVM. In this paper, we implement IRFuzzer to investigate the effectiveness of specialized fuzzing of the LLVM compiler backend. We focus on two approaches to improve the fuzzer: guaranteed input validity using constrained mutations and improved feedback quality. The mutator in IRFuzzer is capable of generating a wide range of LLVM IR inputs, including structured control flow, vector types, and function definitions. The system instruments coding patterns in the compiler to monitor the execution status of instruction selection. The instrumentation not only provides a new coverage feedback called matcher table coverage, but also provides an architecture specific guidance to the mutator. We show that IRFuzzer is more effective than existing fuzzers by fuzzing on 29 mature LLVM backend targets. In the process, we reported 74 confirmed new bugs in LLVM upstream, out of which 49 have been fixed, five have been back ported to LLVM 15, showing that specialized fuzzing provides useful and actionable insights to LLVM developers.</p></details> |  |

Incorporating Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) into product designs has become a standard practice for safeguarding sensitive user information. However, vulnerabilities within these components present significant risks, if exploited by attackers, these vulnerabilities could lead to the leakage of sensitive data, thereby compromising user privacy and security. This research centers on trusted applications (TAs) within the Qualcomm TEE and introduces a novel emulator specifically designed for these applications. Through reverse engineering techniques, we thoroughly analyze Qualcomm TAs and develop a partial emulation environment that accurately emulates their behavior. Additionally, we integrate fuzzing testing techniques into the emulator to systematically uncover potential vulnerabilities within Qualcomm TAs, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in identifying real-world security flaws. This research makes a significant contribution by being the first to provide both the implementation methods and source codes for a Qualcomm TAs emulator, offering a valuable reference for future research efforts. Unlike previous approaches that relied on complex and resource-intensive full-system simulations, our approach is lightweight and effective, making security testing of TA more convenient.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is currently under review for presentation at the USENIX Security 2025 poster session</p></details> |

But due to insufficient analysis of the program structure and lack of flexibility and configurability it can lose efficiency. In this paper, we enhance directed fuzzing with context weights for graph nodes and resolve indirect edges during call graph construction. We construct flexible tool for directed fuzzing with components able to be easily combined with other techniques. We implement proposed method in three separate modules: DiFuzzLLVM library for graph construction and indirect calls resolving, DiFuzz static analysis tool for processing program graphs and computing proximity metrics, and LibAFL-DiFuzz directed fuzzer based on LibAFL fuzzing library. We create additional LibAFL modules for enabling custom power scheduling and static instrumentation. We evaluate indirect calls resolving and get increase in directed fuzzing efficiency for reaching deeper target points. We evaluate context weights contribution and get benefits in TTE and scheduling iterations number. We evaluate our fuzzer in comparison with AFLGo and BEACON, and reveal speedup in time to exposure on several benchmarks. Furthermore, our tool implements some important usability features that are not available in mentioned tools: target points detection, multiple target points support, etc.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Approach to Directed Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04855v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program analysis and automated testing have recently become an essential part of SSDLC. Directed greybox fuzzing is one of the most popular automated testing methods that focuses on error detection in predefined code regions. However, it still lacks ability to overcome difficult program constraints. This problem can be well addressed by symbolic execution, but at the cost of lower performance. Thus, combining directed fuzzing and symbolic execution techniques can lead to more efficient error detection. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach to directed fuzzing with novel seed scheduling algorithm, based on target-related interestingness and coverage. The approach also performs minimization and sorting of objective seeds according to a target-related information. We implement our approach in Sydr-Fuzz tool using LibAFL-DiFuzz as directed fuzzer and Sydr as dynamic symbolic executor. We evaluate our approach with Time to Exposure metric and compare it with pure LibAFL-DiFuzz, AFLGo, BEACON, WAFLGo, WindRanger, FishFuzz, and Prospector. The results show an improvement for 3 out of 7 examples with speedup up to 1.86 times over the second best result, as well as a significant improvement for 3 out of 7 examples over the pure LibAFL-DiFuzz fuzzer. Sydr-Fuzz hybrid approach to directed fuzzing shows high performance and helps to improve directed fuzzing efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fuzzing-based Mutation Testing of C/C++ Software in Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24100v3)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mutation testing can help minimize the delivery of faulty software. Therefore, it is a recommended practice for developing embedded software in safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, state-of-the-art mutation testing techniques for C and C++ software, which are common languages for CPS, depend on symbolic execution. Unfortunately, symbolic execution's limitations hinder its applicability (e.g., systems with black-box components). We propose relying on fuzz testing, which has demonstrated its effectiveness for C and C++ software. Fuzz testing tools automatically create test inputs that explore program branches in various ways, exercising statements in different program states, and thus enabling the detection of mutants, which is our objective. We empirically evaluated our approach using software components from operational satellite systems. Our assessment shows that our approach can detect between 40% and 90% of the mutants not detected by developers' test suites. Further, we empirically determined that the best results are obtained by integrating the Clang compiler, a memory address sanitizer, and relying on laf-intel instrumentation to collect coverage and guide fuzzing. Our approach detects a significantly higher percentage of live mutants compared to symbolic execution, with an increase of up to 50 percentage points; further, we observed that although the combination of fuzzing and symbolic execution leads to additional mutants being killed, the benefits are minimal (a gain of less than one percentage point).</p></details> |  |
| **[FuzzFeed: An Automatic Approach to Weakest Precondition Generation using LLMs and Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05272v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The weakest precondition (WP) of a program describes the largest set of initial states from which all terminating executions of the program satisfy a given postcondition. The generation of WPs is an important task with practical applications in areas ranging from verification to run-time error checking. This paper proposes the combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and fuzz testing for generating WPs. In pursuit of this goal, we introduce Fuzzing Guidance (FG); FG acts as a means of directing LLMs towards correct WPs using program execution feedback. FG utilises fuzz testing for approximately checking the validity and weakness of candidate WPs, this information is then fed back to the LLM as a means of context refinement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a comprehensive benchmark set of deterministic array programs in Java. Our experiments indicate that LLMs are capable of producing viable candidate WPs, and that this ability can be practically enhanced through FG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fuzzing: Randomness? Reasoning! Efficient Directed Fuzzing via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22065v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzing is highly effective in detecting bugs due to the key contribution of randomness. However, randomness significantly reduces the efficiency of fuzzing, causing it to cost days or weeks to expose bugs. Even though directed fuzzing reduces randomness by guiding fuzzing towards target buggy locations, the dilemma of randomness still challenges directed fuzzers. Two critical components, which are seeds and mutators, contain randomness and are closely tied to the conditions required for triggering bugs. Therefore, to address the challenge of randomness, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to remove the randomness in seeds and reduce the randomness in mutators. With their strong reasoning and code generation capabilities, LLMs can be used to generate reachable seeds that target pre-determined locations and to construct bug-specific mutators tailored for specific bugs. We propose RandLuzz, which integrates LLMs and directed fuzzing, to improve the quality of seeds and mutators, resulting in efficient bug exposure. RandLuzz analyzes function call chain or functionality to guide LLMs in generating reachable seeds. To construct bug-specific mutators, RandLuzz uses LLMs to perform bug analysis, obtaining information such as bug causes and mutation suggestions, which further help generate code that performs bug-specific mutations. We evaluate RandLuzz by comparing it with four state-of-the-art directed fuzzers, AFLGo, Beacon, WindRanger, and SelectFuzz. With RandLuzz-generated seeds, the fuzzers achieve an average speedup ranging from 2.1$\times$ to 4.8$\times$ compared to using widely-used initial seeds. Additionally, when evaluated on individual bugs, RandLuzz achieves up to a 2.7$\times$ speedup compared to the second-fastest exposure. On 8 bugs, RandLuzz can even expose them within 60 seconds.</p></details> |  |

However, current DGF tools are constrained by insufficient runtime feedback, limiting their efficiency in reaching targets and exploring state spaces. This study presents HF-DGF, a novel directed grey-box fuzzing framework. Its seed scheduling is guided by a hybrid feedback mechanism integrating control-flow distance, value-flow influence score, and slice coverage. To enable precise control-flow distance feedback, we propose a backward-stepping algorithm to calculate basic block-level seed distances on a virtual inter-procedural control-flow graph (ICFG). For effective state space exploration, we introduce value-flow influence and a corresponding metric, the value-flow influence score. Additionally, to mitigate runtime overhead from hybrid feedback, we adopt a novel selective instrumentation strategy. Evaluations on 41 real-world vulnerabilities show HF-DGF outperforms existing tools: it achieves crash reproduction 5.05 times faster than AFL, 5.79 times faster than AFLGo, 73.75 times faster than WindRanger, 2.56 times faster than DAFL, and 8.45 times faster than Beacon on average. Notably, when all fuzzers triggered crashes, HF-DGF exhibited the lowest code coverage, demonstrating superior directionality and efficiency. It also surpasses AFLGo, WindRanger, DAFL, and Beacon in static analysis efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Given the high costs of manually creating test cases, automated test case generation, particularly methods utilizing large language models, has become increasingly popular. These neural approaches generate semantically meaningful tests that are more maintainable compared with traditional automatic testing methods like fuzzing. However, the diversity and volume of unit tests in current datasets are limited, especially for newer but important languages. In this paper, we present a novel data augmentation technique, FuzzAug, that introduces the benefits of fuzzing to large language models by introducing valid testing semantics and providing diverse coverage-guided inputs. Doubling the size of training datasets, FuzzAug improves the performance from the baselines significantly. This technique demonstrates the potential of introducing prior knowledge from dynamic software analysis to improve neural test generation, offering significant enhancements in neural test generation.</p></details> | new version |
| **[Fuzz-Testing Meets LLM-Based Agents: An Automated and Efficient Framework for Jailbreaking Text-To-Image Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00523v3)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation by transforming textual descriptions into high-quality images. However, these models are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where carefully crafted prompts bypass safety mechanisms to produce unsafe content. While researchers have developed various jailbreak attacks to expose this risk, these methods face significant limitations, including impractical access requirements, easily detectable unnatural prompts, restricted search spaces, and high query demands on the target system. In this paper, we propose JailFuzzer, a novel fuzzing framework driven by large language model (LLM) agents, designed to efficiently generate natural and semantically meaningful jailbreak prompts in a black-box setting. Specifically, JailFuzzer employs fuzz-testing principles with three components: a seed pool for initial and jailbreak prompts, a guided mutation engine for generating meaningful variations, and an oracle function to evaluate jailbreak success. Furthermore, we construct the guided mutation engine and oracle function by LLM-based agents, which further ensures efficiency and adaptability in black-box settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JailFuzzer has significant advantages in jailbreaking T2I models. It generates natural and semantically coherent prompts, reducing the likelihood of detection by traditional defenses. Additionally, it achieves a high success rate in jailbreak attacks with minimal query overhead, outperforming existing methods across all key metrics. This study underscores the need for stronger safety mechanisms in generative models and provides a foundation for future research on defending against sophisticated jailbreaking attacks.

Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific types, or rely heavily on manual intervention. To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library. Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically, facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We evaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20 known memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.</p></details> |  |

Traditional fuzzing evaluations typically focus on overall fuzzer performance across a set of target programs, yet few benchmarks consider how fine-grained program features influence fuzzing effectiveness. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark designed to generate programs with configurable, fine-grained program features to enhance fuzzing evaluations. We reviewed 25 recent grey-box fuzzing studies, extracting 7 program features related to control-flow and data-flow that can impact fuzzer performance. Using these features, we generated a benchmark consisting of 153 programs controlled by 10 fine-grained configurable parameters. We evaluated 11 popular fuzzers using this benchmark. The results indicate that fuzzer performance varies significantly based on the program features and their strengths, highlighting the importance of incorporating program characteristics into fuzzing evaluations.</p></details> |  |

Traditional taint analysis can track such bytes white-box, but suffers from scalability issue. Fuzzing-Driven Taint Inference (FTI) offers a black-box alternative, yet typically incurs significant runtime overhead due to extra program executions. We observe that the commonly used havoc mutation scheme in fuzzing can be adapted for lightweight FTI with zero extra executions. We present a computational model of havoc mode, demonstrating that it can perform FTI while generating new test cases. Building on this, we propose ZTaint-Havoc, a novel, efficient FTI with minimal overhead (3.84% on UniBench, 12.58% on FuzzBench). We further design an effective mutation algorithm utilizing the identified hot bytes. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that ZTaint-Havoc, implemented in AFL++, improves edge coverage by up to 33.71% on FuzzBench and 51.12% on UniBench over vanilla AFL++, with average gains of 2.97% and 6.12% in 24-hour fuzzing campaigns.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear on 34th ISSTA</p></details> |

However, its adoption remains challenging for practitioners due to fundamental differences between SCs and traditional software systems. In this study, we investigate the challenges practitioners face when adopting SC fuzzing tools by conducting an inductive content analysis of 381 GitHub issues from two widely used SC fuzzers: Echidna and Foundry. Furthermore, we conducted a user study to examine how these challenges affect different practitioner groups, SC developers, and traditional software security professionals, and identify strategies practitioners use to overcome them. We systematically categorize these challenges into a taxonomy based on their nature and occurrence within the SC fuzzing workflow. Our findings reveal domain-specific ease-of-use and usefulness challenges, including technical issues with blockchain emulation, and human issues with a lack of accessible documentation and process automation. Our results provide actionable insights for tool developers and researchers, guiding future improvements in SC fuzzer tool design.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present TurboFuzzLLM, a mutation-based fuzzing technique for efficiently finding a collection of effective jailbreaking templates that, when combined with harmful questions, can lead a target LLM to produce harmful responses through black-box access via user prompts. We describe the limitations of directly applying existing template-based attacking techniques in practice, and present functional and efficiency-focused upgrades we added to mutation-based fuzzing to generate effective jailbreaking templates automatically. TurboFuzzLLM achieves $\geq$ 95\% attack success rates (ASR) on public datasets for leading LLMs (including GPT-4o \& GPT-4 Turbo), shows impressive generalizability to unseen harmful questions, and helps in improving model defenses to prompt attacks.

However, a significant gap still exists before it can be applied in industry. This paper aims to summarize the current progress of hardware fuzzing from an industry-use perspective and propose solutions to bridge the gap between hardware fuzzing and industrial verification. First, we review recent hardware fuzzing methods and analyze their compatibilities with industrial verification. We establish criteria to assess whether a hardware fuzzing approach is compatible. Second, we examine whether current verification tools can efficiently support hardware fuzzing. We identify the bottlenecks in hardware fuzzing performance caused by insufficient support from the industrial environment. To overcome the bottlenecks, we propose a prototype, HwFuzzEnv, providing the necessary support for hardware fuzzing. With this prototype, the previous hardware fuzzing method can achieve a several hundred times speedup in industrial settings. Our work could serve as a reference for EDA companies, encouraging them to enhance their tools to support hardware fuzzing efficiently in industrial verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI 2025</p></details> |

Fuzzing test, as an efficient and traditional software testing method, has been widely adopted across various domains. Meanwhile, the rapid development in Large Language Models (LLMs) has facilitated their application in the field of software testing, demonstrating remarkable performance. As existing fuzzing test techniques are not fully automated and software vulnerabilities continue to evolve, there is a growing interest in leveraging large language models to generate fuzzing test. In this paper, we present a systematic overview of the developments that utilize large language models for the fuzzing test. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that covers the intersection of three areas, including LLMs, fuzzing test, and fuzzing test generated based on LLMs. A statistical analysis and discussion of the literature are conducted by summarizing the state-of-the-art methods up to date of the submission. Our work also investigates the potential for widespread deployment and application of fuzzing test techniques generated by LLMs in the future, highlighting their promise for advancing automated software testing practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[SynFuzz: Leveraging Fuzzing of Netlist to Detect Synthesis Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18812v2)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the evolving landscape of integrated circuit (IC) design, the increasing complexity of modern processors and intellectual property (IP) cores has introduced new challenges in ensuring design correctness and security. The recent advancements in hardware fuzzing techniques have shown their efficacy in detecting hardware bugs and vulnerabilities at the RTL abstraction level of hardware. However, they suffer from several limitations, including an inability to address vulnerabilities introduced during synthesis and gate-level transformations. These methods often fail to detect issues arising from library adversaries, where compromised or malicious library components can introduce backdoors or unintended behaviors into the design. In this paper, we present a novel hardware fuzzer, SynFuzz, designed to overcome the limitations of existing hardware fuzzing frameworks. SynFuzz focuses on fuzzing hardware at the gate-level netlist to identify synthesis bugs and vulnerabilities that arise during the transition from RTL to the gate-level. We analyze the intrinsic hardware behaviors using coverage metrics specifically tailored for the gate-level. Furthermore, SynFuzz implements differential fuzzing to uncover bugs associated with EDA libraries. We evaluated SynFuzz on popular open-source processors and IP designs, successfully identifying 7 new synthesis bugs. Additionally, by exploiting the optimization settings of EDA tools, we performed a compromised library mapping attack (CLiMA), creating a malicious version of hardware designs that remains undetectable by traditional verification methods. We also demonstrate how SynFuzz overcomes the limitations of the industry-standard formal verification tool, Cadence Conformal, providing a more robust and comprehensive approach to hardware verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[ROSA: Finding Backdoors with Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08544v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A code-level backdoor is a hidden access, programmed and concealed within the code of a program. For instance, hard-coded credentials planted in the code of a file server application would enable maliciously logging into all deployed instances of this application. Confirmed software supply chain attacks have led to the injection of backdoors into popular open-source projects, and backdoors have been discovered in various router firmware. Manual code auditing for backdoors is challenging and existing semi-automated approaches can handle only a limited scope of programs and backdoors, while requiring manual reverse-engineering of the audited (binary) program. Graybox fuzzing (automated semi-randomized testing) has grown in popularity due to its success in discovering vulnerabilities and hence stands as a strong candidate for improved backdoor detection. However, current fuzzing knowledge does not offer any means to detect the triggering of a backdoor at runtime. In this work we introduce ROSA, a novel approach (and tool) which combines a state-of-the-art fuzzer (AFL++) with a new metamorphic test oracle, capable of detecting runtime backdoor triggers. To facilitate the evaluation of ROSA, we have created ROSARUM, the first openly available benchmark for assessing the detection of various backdoors in diverse programs. Experimental evaluation shows that ROSA has a level of robustness, speed and automation similar to classical fuzzing. It finds all 17 authentic or synthetic backdooors from ROSARUM in 1h30 on average. Compared to existing detection tools, it can handle a diversity of backdoors and programs and it does not rely on manual reverse-engineering of the fuzzed binary code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Fuzzing of Automotive Control Units](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12345v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern vehicles are governed by a network of Electronic Control Units (ECUs), which are programmed to sense inputs from the driver and the environment, to process these inputs, and to control actuators that, e.g., regulate the engine or even control the steering system. ECUs within a vehicle communicate via automotive bus systems such as the Controller Area Network (CAN), and beyond the vehicles boundaries through upcoming vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure channels. Approaches to manipulate the communication between ECUs for the purpose of security testing and reverse-engineering of vehicular functions have been presented in the past, all of which struggle with automating the detection of system change in response to message injection. In this paper we present our findings with fuzzing CAN networks, in particular while observing individual ECUs with a sensor harness. The harness detects physical responses, which we then use in a oracle functions to inform the fuzzing process. We systematically define fuzzers, fuzzing configurations and oracle functions for testing ECUs. We evaluate our approach based on case studies of commercial instrument clusters and with an experimental framework for CAN authentication. Our results show that the approach is capable of identifying interesting ECU states with a high level of automation. Our approach is applicable in distributed cyber-physical systems beyond automotive computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared in 2019 International Workshop on Attacks and Defenses for Internet-of-Things (ADIoT) / International Workshop on the Secure Internet of Things (SIoT)</p></details> |
| **[An Empirical Study of Fuzz Harness Degradation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06177v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The purpose of continuous fuzzing platforms is to enable fuzzing for software projects via \emph{fuzz harnesses} -- but as the projects continue to evolve, are these harnesses updated in lockstep, or do they run out of date? If these harnesses remain unmaintained, will they \emph{degrade} over time in terms of coverage achieved or number of bugs found? This is the subject of our study. We study Google's OSS-Fuzz continuous fuzzing platform containing harnesses for 510 open-source C/C++ projects, many of which are security-critical. A harness is the glue code between the fuzzer and the project, so it needs to adapt to changes in the project. It is often added by a project maintainer or as part of a, sometimes short-lived, testing effort. Our analysis shows a consistent overall fuzzer coverage percentage for projects in OSS-Fuzz and a surprising longevity of the bug-finding capability of harnesses even without explicit updates, as long as they still build. However, we also identify and manually examine individual cases of harness coverage degradation and categorize their root causes. Furthermore, we contribute to OSS-Fuzz and Fuzz Introspector to support metrics to detect harness degradation in OSS-Fuzz projects guided by this research.</p></details> | 16 pages, 26 figures |

However, existing methods often suffer from path explosion and randomness in input mutation, leading to inefficiencies in exploring and exploiting target paths. In this paper, we propose HGFuzzer, an automatic framework that leverages the large language model (LLM) to address these challenges. HGFuzzer transforms path constraint problems into targeted code generation tasks, systematically generating test harnesses and reachable inputs to reduce unnecessary exploration paths significantly. Additionally, we implement custom mutators designed specifically for target functions, minimizing randomness and improving the precision of directed fuzzing. We evaluated HGFuzzer on 20 real-world vulnerabilities, successfully triggering 17, including 11 within the first minute, achieving a speedup of at least 24.8x compared to state-of-the-art directed fuzzers. Furthermore, HGFuzzer discovered 9 previously unknown vulnerabilities, all of which were assigned CVE IDs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in identifying real-world vulnerabilities.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Due to nondeterministic I/O operations, traditional testing methods struggle to rapidly achieve coverage of firmware code areas that require extensive I/O accumulation. To address this challenge, we propose a state data-aware fuzzing approach that leverages SSD firmware's internal state to guide input generation under nondeterministic I/O conditions and accelerate coverage discovery. Our experiments with an open-source SSD firmware emulator show that the proposed method achieves the same firmware test coverage as a state-of-the-art coverage-based fuzzer (AFL++) while requiring approximately 67% fewer commands, without reducing the number of crashes or hangs detected. Moreover, we extend our experiments by incorporating various I/O commands beyond basic write/read operations to reflect real user scenarios, and we confirm that our strategy remains effective even for multiple types of I/O tests. We further validate the effectiveness of state data-aware fuzzing for firmware testing under I/O environments and suggest that this approach can be extended to other storage firmware or threshold-based embedded systems in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Learning-Guided Fuzzing for Testing Stateful SDN Controllers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08626v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllers for software-defined networks (SDNs) are centralised software components that enable advanced network functionalities, such as dynamic traffic engineering and network virtualisation. However, these functionalities increase the complexity of SDN controllers, making thorough testing crucial. SDN controllers are stateful, interacting with multiple network devices through sequences of control messages. Identifying stateful failures in an SDN controller is challenging due to the infinite possible sequences of control messages, which result in an unbounded number of stateful interactions between the controller and network devices. In this article, we propose SeqFuzzSDN, a learning-guided fuzzing method for testing stateful SDN controllers. SeqFuzzSDN aims to (1) efficiently explore the state space of the SDN controller under test, (2) generate effective and diverse tests (i.e., control message sequences) to uncover failures, and (3) infer accurate failure-inducing models that characterise the message sequences leading to failures. In addition, we compare SeqFuzzSDN with three extensions of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for fuzzing SDNs. Our findings show that, compared to the extended SOTA methods, SeqFuzzSDN (1) generates more diverse message sequences that lead to failures within the same time budget, and (2) produces more accurate failure-inducing models, significantly outperforming the other extended SOTA methods in terms of sensitivity.</p></details> |  |

It is used in production code by major industry players and got recommended by government bodies. Rust provides strong security guarantees achieved by design utilizing the concepts of ownership and borrowing. However, Rust allows programmers to write unsafe code which is not subject to the strict Rust security policy. Empirical studies show that security issues in practice always involve code written in unsafe Rust. In this paper, we present the first approach that utilizes selective code coverage feedback to focus the fuzzing efforts on unsafe Rust code. Our approach significantly improves the efficiency when fuzzing Rust programs and does not require additional computational resources while fuzz testing the target. To quantify the impact of partial code instrumentation, we implement our approach by extending the capabilities of the Rust compiler toolchain. We present an automated approach to detect unsafe and safe code components to decide which parts of the program a fuzzer should focus on when running a fuzzing campaign to find vulnerabilities in Rust programs. Our approach is fully compatible with existing fuzzing implementations and does not require complex manual work, thus retaining the existing high usability standard. Focusing on unsafe code, our implementation allows us to generate inputs that trigger more unsafe code locations with statistical significance and therefore is able to detect potential vulnerabilities in a shorter time span while imposing no performance overhead during fuzzing itself.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE) 2025</p></details> |

Contextually, in vulnerability discovery, fuzzing has been used as an effective dynamic analysis technique, although it requires manually writing fuzz drivers. Fuzz drivers usually target a limited subset of functions in a library that must be chosen according to certain criteria, e.g., the depth of a function, the number of paths. These criteria are verified by components called target oracles. In this work, we propose an automated fuzz driver generation workflow composed of: (1) identifying a likely vulnerable function by leveraging a machine learning for vulnerability detection model as a target oracle, (2) automatically generating fuzz drivers, (3) fuzzing the target function to find bugs which could confirm the vulnerability inferred by the target oracle. We show our method on an existing vulnerability in libgd, with a plan for large-scale evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[PatchFuzz: Patch Fuzzing for JavaScript Engines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00289v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Patch fuzzing is a technique aimed at identifying vulnerabilities that arise from newly patched code. While researchers have made efforts to apply patch fuzzing to testing JavaScript engines with considerable success, these efforts have been limited to using ordinary test cases or publicly available vulnerability PoCs (Proof of Concepts) as seeds, and the sustainability of these approaches is hindered by the challenges associated with automating the PoC collection. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end sustainable approach for JavaScript engine patch fuzzing, named PatchFuzz. It automates the collection of PoCs of a broader range of historical vulnerabilities and leverages both the PoCs and their corresponding patches to uncover new vulnerabilities more effectively. PatchFuzz starts by recognizing git commits which intend to fix security bugs. Subsequently, it extracts and processes PoCs from these commits to form the seeds for fuzzing, while utilizing code revisions to focus limited fuzzing resources on the more vulnerable code areas through selective instrumentation. The mutation strategy of PatchFuzz is also optimized to maximize the potential of the PoCs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PatchFuzz. Notably, 54 bugs across six popular JavaScript engines have been exposed and a total of $62,500 bounties has been received.</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |

Despite significant progress in the field, implementing and using ZKPs via \emph{ZKP circuits} remains challenging, leading to numerous bugs that affect ZKP circuits in practice, and \emph{fuzzing} remains largely unexplored as a method to detect bugs in ZKP circuits. We discuss the unique challenges of applying fuzzing to ZKP circuits, examine the oracle problem and its potential solutions, and propose techniques for input generation and test harness construction. We demonstrate that fuzzing can be effective in this domain by implementing a fuzzer for \texttt{zk-regex}, a cornerstone library in modern ZKP applications.

Hardware fuzzing testing techniques have recently shown promising results in discovering transient execution bugs in large-scale out-of-order processor designs. However, their poor microarchitectural controllability and observability prevent them from effectively and efficiently detecting transient execution vulnerabilities. This paper proposes DejaVuzz, a novel pre-silicon stage processor transient execution bug fuzzer. DejaVuzz utilizes two innovative operating primitives: dynamic swappable memory and differential information flow tracking, enabling more effective and efficient transient execution vulnerability detection. The dynamic swappable memory enables the isolation of different instruction streams within the same address space. Leveraging this capability, DejaVuzz generates targeted training for arbitrary transient windows and eliminates ineffective training, enabling efficient triggering of diverse transient windows. The differential information flow tracking aids in observing the propagation of sensitive data across the microarchitecture. Based on taints, DejaVuzz designs the taint coverage matrix to guide mutation and uses taint liveness annotations to identify exploitable leakages. Our evaluation shows that DejaVuzz outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzer SpecDoctor, triggering more comprehensive transient windows with lower training overhead and achieving a 4.7x coverage improvement. And DejaVuzz also mitigates control flow over-tainting with acceptable overhead and identifies 5 previously undiscovered transient execution vulnerabilities (with 6 CVEs assigned) on BOOM and XiangShan.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to ASPLOS 2025</p></details> |

Our proposal to consider a sequence of messages as a seed for coverage-directed greybox fuzzing, to associate each message with the corresponding protocol state, and to maximize the coverage of both the state space and the code was first published in 2020 in a short tool demonstration paper. AFLNet was the first code- and state-coverage-guided protocol fuzzer; it used the response code as an indicator of the current protocol state. Over the past five years, the tool paper has gathered hundreds of citations, the code repository was forked almost 200 times and has seen over thirty pull requests from practitioners and researchers, and our initial proposal has been improved upon in many significant ways. In this paper, we first provide an extended discussion and a full empirical evaluation of the technical contributions of AFLNet and then reflect on the impact that our approach and our tool had in the past five years, on both the research and the practice of protocol fuzzing.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

We propose SandBoxFuzz, a scalable grey-box fuzzing technique that addresses these limitations by leveraging aspect-oriented programming and runtime reflection to enable dynamic specification mining, generating targeted inputs for constrained environments. SandBoxFuzz also introduces a log-based coverage mechanism, seamlessly integrated into the build pipeline, eliminating the need for runtime coverage agents that are often infeasible in industrial settings. SandBoxFuzz has been successfully deployed to Ant Group's production line and, compared to an initial solution built on a state-of-the-art fuzzing framework, it demonstrates superior performance in their microservices software. SandBoxFuzz achieves a 7.5% increase in branch coverage, identifies 1,850 additional exceptions, and reduces setup time from hours to minutes, highlighting its effectiveness and practical utility in a real-world industrial environment. By open-sourcing SandBoxFuzz, we provide a practical and effective tool for researchers and practitioners to test large-scale microservices systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ES-FUZZ: Improving the Coverage of Firmware Fuzzing with Stateful and Adaptable MMIO Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06281v3)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gray-box fuzzing is widely used for testing embedded systems (ESes). State-of-the-art (SOTA) gray-box fuzzers test ES firmware in fully emulated environments without real peripherals. They emulate missing peripherals to achieve decent code coverage. Some fuzzers infer the memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) behavior of firmware peripherals from the firmware binary. We find that these fuzzers emulate the inferred MMIO behavior using stateless and non-adaptive MMIO models, which perform poorly in handling ES firmware's MMIO reads to collectively retrieve a data chunk. This leaves ample room for improving the code coverage of these fuzzers. We propose ES-Fuzz to improve the code coverage of each such fuzzer using stateful MMIO models that adapt to overcome the fuzzer's coverage bottlenecks. ES-Fuzz runs concurrently with a given fuzzer and starts a new run whenever the fuzzer's coverage stagnates. In each run, ES-Fuzz leverages a high-coverage test case to generate new stateful MMIO models that boost the coverage further. We have implemented ES-Fuzz upon Fuzzware and evaluated it with 24 popular ES firmware. ES-Fuzz is shown to enhance Fuzzware's coverage by up to 54% in 11 of them and trigger additional bugs in 5 of them without hurting the coverage in the remainder. ES-Fuzz's MMIO models are shown to describe a wide range of MMIO-retrieved data chunks and the firmware's usage of the same data chunk in various contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Whilst there is a preponderance of disparate fuzzing tools that target different parts of the test environment, such as the scenario, sensors, and vehicle dynamics, there is a lack of fuzzing strategies that ensemble these fuzzers to enable concurrent fuzzing, utilizing diverse techniques and targets. This research proposes FuzzSense, a modular, black-box, mutation-based fuzzing framework that is architected to ensemble diverse AD fuzzing tools. To validate the utility of FuzzSense, a LiDAR sensor fuzzer was developed as a plug-in, and the fuzzer was implemented in the new AD simulation platform AWSIM and Autoware.Universe AD software platform. The results demonstrated that FuzzSense was able to find vulnerabilities in the new Autoware.Universe software. We contribute to FuzzSense open-source with the aim of initiating a conversation in the community on the design of AD-specific fuzzers and the establishment of a community fuzzing framework to better target the diverse technology base of autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-Based Fuzzing of Cross-Architecture Compilers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08967v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>OneAPI is an open standard that supports cross-architecture software development with minimal effort from developers. It brings DPC++ and C++ compilers which need to be thoroughly tested to verify their correctness, reliability, and security. Compilers have numerous code flows and optimization features. This process requires developers with deep understanding of the different compiler flows to craft testcases specific to target paths in the compiler. This testcase creation is a time-consuming and costly process. In this paper, we propose a large-language model (LLM)-based compiler fuzzing tool that integrates the concept of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This tool automates the testcase generation task and relieves experienced compiler developers from investing time to craft testcase generation patterns. We test our proposed approach on the Intel DPC++/C++ compiler. This compiler compiles SYCL code and allows developers to offload it to different architectures, e.g. GPUs and CPUs from different vendors. Using this tool, we managed to identify 87 SYCL code test cases that lead to output value mismatch or compiler runtime errors when compiled using Intel DPC++ and clang++ compilers and run on different architectures. The testcases and the identified unexpected behaviors of the compilers under test were obtained within only few hours with no prior background on the compiler passes under tests. This tool facilitates efficient compiler fuzzing with reduced developer time requirements via the dynamic testcase creation capability provided by an LLM with RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[PROMPTFUZZ: Harnessing Fuzzing Techniques for Robust Testing of Prompt Injection in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14729v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread use in various applications due to their powerful capability to generate human-like text. However, prompt injection attacks, which involve overwriting a model's original instructions with malicious prompts to manipulate the generated text, have raised significant concerns about the security and reliability of LLMs. Ensuring that LLMs are robust against such attacks is crucial for their deployment in real-world applications, particularly in critical tasks. In this paper, we propose PROMPTFUZZ, a novel testing framework that leverages fuzzing techniques to systematically assess the robustness of LLMs against prompt injection attacks. Inspired by software fuzzing, PROMPTFUZZ selects promising seed prompts and generates a diverse set of prompt injections to evaluate the target LLM's resilience. PROMPTFUZZ operates in two stages: the prepare phase, which involves selecting promising initial seeds and collecting few-shot examples, and the focus phase, which uses the collected examples to generate diverse, high-quality prompt injections. Using PROMPTFUZZ, we can uncover more vulnerabilities in LLMs, even those with strong defense prompts. By deploying the generated attack prompts from PROMPTFUZZ in a real-world competition, we achieved the 7th ranking out of over 4000 participants (top 0.14%) within 2 hours. Additionally, we construct a dataset to fine-tune LLMs for enhanced robustness against prompt injection attacks. While the fine-tuned model shows improved robustness, PROMPTFUZZ continues to identify vulnerabilities, highlighting the importance of robust testing for LLMs. Our work emphasizes the critical need for effective testing tools and provides a practical framework for evaluating and improving the robustness of LLMs against prompt injection attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[KernelGPT: Enhanced Kernel Fuzzing via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00563v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bugs in operating system kernels can affect billions of devices and users all over the world. As a result, a large body of research has been focused on kernel fuzzing, i.e., automatically generating syscall (system call) sequences to detect potential kernel bugs or vulnerabilities. Kernel fuzzing aims to generate valid syscall sequences guided by syscall specifications that define both the syntax and semantics of syscalls. While there has been existing work trying to automate syscall specification generation, this remains largely manual work, and a large number of important syscalls are still uncovered. In this paper, we propose KernelGPT, the first approach to automatically synthesizing syscall specifications via Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced kernel fuzzing. Our key insight is that LLMs have seen massive kernel code, documentation, and use cases during pre-training, and thus can automatically distill the necessary information for making valid syscalls. More specifically, KernelGPT leverages an iterative approach to automatically infer the specifications, and further debug and repair them based on the validation feedback. Our results demonstrate that KernelGPT can generate more new and valid specifications and achieve higher coverage than state-of-the-art techniques. So far, by using newly generated specifications, KernelGPT has already detected 24 new unique bugs in Linux kernel, with 12 fixed and 11 assigned with CVE numbers. Moreover, a number of specifications generated by KernelGPT have already been merged into the kernel fuzzer Syzkaller, following the request from its development team.</p></details> | ASPLOS 2025 |
| **[JBFuzz: Jailbreaking LLMs Efficiently and Effectively Using Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08990v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise as language understanding and decision making tools, and they have permeated various aspects of our everyday life. However, their widespread availability also comes with novel risks, such as generating harmful, unethical, or offensive content, via an attack called jailbreaking. Despite extensive efforts from LLM developers to align LLMs using human feedback, they are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks. To tackle this issue, researchers often employ red-teaming to understand and investigate jailbreak prompts. However, existing red-teaming approaches lack effectiveness, scalability, or both. To address these issues, we propose JBFuzz, a novel effective, automated, and scalable red-teaming technique for jailbreaking LLMs. JBFuzz is inspired by the success of fuzzing for detecting bugs/vulnerabilities in software. We overcome three challenges related to effectiveness and scalability by devising novel seed prompts, a lightweight mutation engine, and a lightweight and accurate evaluator for guiding the fuzzer. Assimilating all three solutions results in a potent fuzzer that only requires black-box access to the target LLM. We perform extensive experimental evaluation of JBFuzz using nine popular and widely-used LLMs. We find that JBFuzz successfully jailbreaks all LLMs for various harmful/unethical questions, with an average attack success rate of 99%. We also find that JBFuzz is extremely efficient as it jailbreaks a given LLM for a given question in 60 seconds on average. Our work highlights the susceptibility of the state-of-the-art LLMs to jailbreak attacks even after safety alignment, and serves as a valuable red-teaming tool for LLM developers.</p></details> |  |
| **[XMutant: XAI-based Fuzzing for Deep Learning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07222v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic-based test generators are widely used to produce failure-inducing inputs for Deep Learning (DL) systems. They typically generate challenging test inputs by applying random perturbations to input semantic concepts until a failure is found or a timeout is reached. However, such randomness may hinder them from efficiently achieving their goal. This paper proposes XMutant, a technique that leverages explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to generate challenging test inputs. XMutant uses the local explanation of the input to inform the fuzz testing process and effectively guide it toward failures of the DL system under test. We evaluated different configurations of XMutant in triggering failures for different DL systems both for model-level (sentiment analysis, digit recognition) and system-level testing (advanced driving assistance). Our studies showed that XMutant enables more effective and efficient test generation by focusing on the most impactful parts of the input. XMutant generates up to 125% more failure-inducing inputs compared to an existing baseline, up to 7X faster. We also assessed the validity of these inputs, maintaining a validation rate above 89%, according to automated and human validators.</p></details> | 32 pages |
| **[Towards Large Language Model Guided Kernel Direct Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02301v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct kernel fuzzing is a targeted approach that focuses on specific areas of the kernel, effectively addressing the challenges of frequent updates and the inherent complexity of operating systems, which are critical infrastructure. This paper introduces SyzAgent, a framework that integrates LLMs with the state-of-the-art kernel fuzzer Syzkaller, where the LLMs are used to guide the mutation and generation of test cases in real-time. We present preliminary results demonstrating that this method is effective on around 67\% cases in our benchmark during the experiment.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAPILLON: Efficient and Stealthy Fuzz Testing-Powered Jailbreaks for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14866v5)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in various tasks but are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where attackers create jailbreak prompts to mislead the model to produce harmful or offensive content. Current jailbreak methods either rely heavily on manually crafted templates, which pose challenges in scalability and adaptability, or struggle to generate semantically coherent prompts, making them easy to detect. Additionally, most existing approaches involve lengthy prompts, leading to higher query costs. In this paper, to remedy these challenges, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack framework called PAPILLON, which is an automated, black-box jailbreaking attack framework that adapts the black-box fuzz testing approach with a series of customized designs. Instead of relying on manually crafted templates,PAPILLON starts with an empty seed pool, removing the need to search for any related jailbreaking templates. We also develop three novel question-dependent mutation strategies using an LLM helper to generate prompts that maintain semantic coherence while significantly reducing their length. Additionally, we implement a two-level judge module to accurately detect genuine successful jailbreaks. We evaluated PAPILLON on 7 representative LLMs and compared it with 5 state-of-the-art jailbreaking attack strategies. For proprietary LLM APIs, such as GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4, and Gemini-Pro, PAPILLONs achieves attack success rates of over 90%, 80%, and 74%, respectively, exceeding existing baselines by more than 60\%. Additionally, PAPILLON can maintain high semantic coherence while significantly reducing the length of jailbreak prompts. When targeting GPT-4, PAPILLON can achieve over 78% attack success rate even with 100 tokens. Moreover, PAPILLON demonstrates transferability and is robust to state-of-the-art defenses.

| **[Towards Reliable LLM-Driven Fuzz Testing: Vision and Road Ahead](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00795v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzz testing is a crucial component of software security assessment, yet its effectiveness heavily relies on valid fuzz drivers and diverse seed inputs. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer transformative potential for automating fuzz testing (LLM4Fuzz), particularly in generating drivers and seeds. However, current LLM4Fuzz solutions face critical reliability challenges, including low driver validity rates and seed quality trade-offs, hindering their practical adoption. This paper aims to examine the reliability bottlenecks of LLM-driven fuzzing and explores potential research directions to address these limitations. It begins with an overview of the current development of LLM4SE and emphasizes the necessity for developing reliable LLM4Fuzz solutions. Following this, the paper envisions a vision where reliable LLM4Fuzz transforms the landscape of software testing and security for industry, software development practitioners, and economic accessibility. It then outlines a road ahead for future research, identifying key challenges and offering specific suggestions for the researchers to consider. This work strives to spark innovation in the field, positioning reliable LLM4Fuzz as a fundamental component of modern software testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphFuzz: Automated Testing of Graph Algorithm Implementations with Differential Fuzzing and Lightweight Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15160v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph algorithms, such as shortest path finding, play a crucial role in enabling essential applications and services like infrastructure planning and navigation, making their correctness important. However, thoroughly testing graph algorithm implementations poses several challenges, including their vast input space (i.e., arbitrary graphs). Moreover, through our preliminary study, we find that just a few automatically generated graphs (less than 10) could be enough to cover the code of many graph algorithm implementations, rendering the code coverage-guided fuzzing approach -- one of the state-of-the-art search algorithms -- less efficient than expected. To tackle these challenges, we introduce GraphFuzz, the first automated feedback-guided fuzzing framework for graph algorithm implementations. Our key innovation lies in identifying lightweight and algorithm-specific feedback signals to combine with or completely replace the code coverage feedback to enhance the diversity of the test corpus, thereby speeding up the bug-finding process. This novel idea also allows GraphFuzz to effectively work in both black-box (i.e., no code coverage instrumentation/collection is required) and grey-box setups. GraphFuzz applies differential testing to detect both crash-triggering bugs and logic bugs. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of GraphFuzz. The tool has successfully discovered 12 previously unknown bugs, including 6 logic bugs, in 9 graph algorithm implementations in two popular graph libraries, NetworkX and iGraph. All of them have been confirmed and and 11 bugs have been rectified by the libraries' maintainers.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Fuzzing Open-Source Operating Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13163v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vulnerabilities in open-source operating systems (OSs) pose substantial security risks to software systems, making their detection crucial. While fuzzing has been an effective vulnerability detection technique in various domains, OS fuzzing (OSF) faces unique challenges due to OS complexity and multi-layered interaction, and has not been comprehensively reviewed. Therefore, this work systematically surveys the state-of-the-art OSF techniques, categorizes them based on the general fuzzing process, and investigates challenges specific to kernel, file system, driver, and hypervisor fuzzing. Finally, future research directions for OSF are discussed. GitHub: https://github.com/pghk13/Survey-OSF.</p></details> | 45 pages |
| **[SoK: Where to Fuzz? Assessing Target Selection Methods in Directed Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08341v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common paradigm for improving fuzzing performance is to focus on selected regions of a program rather than its entirety. While previous work has largely explored how these locations can be reached, their selection, that is, the where, has received little attention so far. A common paradigm for improving fuzzing performance is to focus on selected regions of a program rather than its entirety. While previous work has largely explored how these locations can be reached, their selection, that is, the where, has received little attention so far. In this paper, we fill this gap and present the first comprehensive analysis of target selection methods for fuzzing. To this end, we examine papers from leading security and software engineering conferences, identifying prevalent methods for choosing targets. By modeling these methods as general scoring functions, we are able to compare and measure their efficacy on a corpus of more than 1,600 crashes from the OSS-Fuzz project. Our analysis provides new insights for target selection in practice: First, we find that simple software metrics significantly outperform other methods, including common heuristics used in directed fuzzing, such as recently modified code or locations with sanitizer instrumentation. Next to this, we identify language models as a promising choice for target selection. In summary, our work offers a new perspective on directed fuzzing, emphasizing the role of target selection as an orthogonal dimension to improve performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAND: Decoupling Sanitization from Fuzzing for Low Overhead](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16497v3)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sanitizers provide robust test oracles for various software vulnerabilities. Fuzzing on sanitizer-enabled programs has been the best practice to find software bugs. Since sanitizers need to heavily instrument a target program to insert run-time checks, sanitizer-enabled programs have much higher overhead compared to normally built programs. In this paper, we present SAND, a new fuzzing framework that decouples sanitization from the fuzzing loop. SAND performs fuzzing on a normally built program and only invokes sanitizer-enabled programs when input is shown to be interesting. Since most of the generated inputs are not interesting, i.e., not bug-triggering, SAND allows most of the fuzzing time to be spent on the normally built program. To identify interesting inputs, we introduce execution pattern for a practical execution analysis on the normally built program. We realize SAND on top of AFL++ and evaluate it on 12 real-world programs. Our extensive evaluation highlights its effectiveness: in 24 hours, compared to all the baseline fuzzers, SAND significantly discovers more bugs while not missing any.</p></details> | Camera-ready version |
| **[Smart Contract Fuzzing Towards Profitable Vulnerabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08834v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Billions of dollars are transacted through smart contracts, making vulnerabilities a major financial risk. One focus in the security arms race is on profitable vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Fuzzing is a key method for identifying these vulnerabilities. However, current solutions face two main limitations: a lack of profit-centric techniques for expediting detection, and insufficient automation in maximizing the profitability of discovered vulnerabilities, leaving the analysis to human experts. To address these gaps, we have developed VERITE, a profit-centric smart contract fuzzing framework that not only effectively detects those profitable vulnerabilities but also maximizes the exploited profits. VERITE has three key features: 1) DeFi action-based mutators for boosting the exploration of transactions with different fund flows; 2) potentially profitable candidates identification criteria, which checks whether the input has caused abnormal fund flow properties during testing; 3) a gradient descent-based profit maximization strategy for these identified candidates. VERITE is fully developed from scratch and evaluated on a dataset consisting of 61 exploited real-world DeFi projects with an average of over 1.1 million dollars loss. The results show that VERITE can automatically extract more than 18 million dollars in total and is significantly better than state-of-the-art fuzzer ITYFUZZ in both detection (29/10) and exploitation (134 times more profits gained on average). Remarkably, in 12 targets, it gains more profits than real-world attacking exploits (1.01 to 11.45 times more). VERITE is also applied by auditors in contract auditing, where 6 (5 high severity) zero-day vulnerabilities are found with over $2,500 bounty rewards.</p></details> | Camera-ready version |
| **[HyperGo: Probability-based Directed Hybrid Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07815v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed grey-box fuzzing (DGF) is a target-guided fuzzing intended for testing specific targets (e.g., the potential buggy code). Despite numerous techniques proposed to enhance directedness, the existing DGF techniques still face challenges, such as taking into account the difficulty of reaching different basic blocks when designing the fitness metric, and promoting the effectiveness of symbolic execution (SE) when solving the complex constraints in the path to the target. In this paper, we propose a directed hybrid fuzzer called HyperGo. To address the challenges, we introduce the concept of path probability and combine the probability with distance to form an adaptive fitness metric called probability-based distance. By combining the two factors, probability-based distance can adaptively guide DGF toward paths that are closer to the target and have more easy-to-satisfy path constraints. Then, we put forward an Optimized Symbolic Execution Complementary (OSEC) scheme to combine DGF and SE in a complementary manner. The OSEC would prune the unreachable branches and unsolvable branches, and prioritize symbolic execution of the seeds whose paths are closer to the target and have more branches that are difficult to be covered by DGF. We evaluated HyperGo on 2 benchmarks consisting of 21 programs with a total of 100 target sites. The experimental results show that HyperGo achieves 38.47$\times$, 30.89$\times$, 28.52$\times$, 106.09$\times$ and 143.22$\times$ speedup compared to AFLGo, AFLGoSy, BEACON, WindRanger, and ParmeSan, respectively in reaching target sites, and 3.44$\times$, 3.63$\times$, 4.10$\times$, 3.26$\times$, and 3.00$\times$ speedup in exposing known vulnerabilities. Moreover, HyperGo discovered 37 undisclosed vulnerabilities from 7 real-world programs.</p></details> | 16 pages |
